            Working in metric makes concrete calculations straightforward. If your
            length, width, and depth are all in metres, the volume in cubic metres
            (m³) is simply length × width × depth — no conversion factor needed.
          </p>

            <p className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-gray-400">Formula</p>
            <p className="mt-3 font-mono text-sm text-gray-700">
              Volume (m³) = Length (m) × Width (m) × Depth (m)

          <p className="mt-5 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            The one thing that trips people up is that UK building drawings typically
            show slab depth in millimetres rather than metres. A depth of 100 mm is
            0.10 m, 150 mm is 0.15 m, and so on. Always divide your millimetre depth
            by 1,000 before plugging it into the calculation. A slab that is 4 m × 3 m
            at 100 mm deep requires 4 × 3 × 0.10 = 1.2 m³.

          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            A typical single-garage base in the UK might measure 5 m × 3 m with a
            150 mm slab — the depth recommended where vehicles will be driven onto it.
            Here&apos;s how the calculation works:

              { step: "3", label: "Add 10% for waste",          value: "2.25 × 1.10 = 2.48 m³ to order" },
              { step: "4", label: "Bags if not using ready-mix", value: "2.48 ÷ 0.012 ≈ 207 bags (25 kg)" },

          <p className="mt-5 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            At 207 bags, this pour is firmly in ready-mix territory. Mixing that by hand
            would take the best part of two days and risk cold joints in the slab. A
            half-load of ready-mix (typically 3–4 m³ minimum from most UK suppliers)
            would cover this comfortably.

                Delivered pre-mixed and poured directly from the truck. Suppliers specify
                strength by BS designation — C20 for domestic slabs and patios, C25 for
                driveways and garage floors, C30 for structural foundations. Most suppliers
                have a minimum order of 1–3 m³. Best for any pour over 1 m³ where
                consistency and speed matter.

              <p className="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
                Ballast is a blend of coarse aggregate and sharp sand, sold in bulk bags
                (usually 850 kg or one tonne). You combine it with cement on-site,
                typically at 6 parts ballast to 1 part cement by weight for a general-purpose
                concrete equivalent to C20. This approach is cost-effective for 0.5–2 m³
                and lets you work at your own pace, but it requires a mixer and more labour.

                Pre-blended bags such as general-purpose concrete mix or rapid-setting
                products like Postcrete are best for small jobs — fence posts, gate pillars,
                steps, or repairs under 0.3 m³. A single 25 kg bag covers approximately
                0.012 m³. Convenient, but the most expensive way to buy concrete per m³.

                q: "How many 25 kg bags per cubic metre?",
                a: "Approximately 83–84 bags, as each 25 kg bag covers around 0.012 m³. With 10% waste, budget for 92 bags per m³. For volumes over 0.5 m³, ready-mix or ballast will be cheaper.",
