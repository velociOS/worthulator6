          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            In the US, ready-mix concrete is sold by the cubic yard. Prices typically
            range from <strong>$120 to $200 per cubic yard</strong>, depending on your
            location, the concrete mix specification (standard, fibre-reinforced, high-PSI),
            and the supplier. Urban areas and markets with high fuel costs tend to sit
            at the top of that range.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            On top of the per-yard price, most suppliers charge a <strong>flat delivery
            fee of $100–$200</strong> per truck. If your order falls below the supplier's
            minimum — usually 5–7 cubic yards — you'll also pay a short-load surcharge
            of $15–$25 per yard under that minimum.
