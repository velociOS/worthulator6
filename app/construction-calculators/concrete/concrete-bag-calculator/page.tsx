          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            The calculation has two stages. First you work out the volume of your
            pour in cubic yards. Then you divide that volume by the yield of one bag
            to get your bag count.
          </p>

            The waste factor accounts for spillage, slightly uneven ground, and the
            concrete that gets left in the mixer or on tools. The default is 5% —
            enough for a well-prepared job. Increase it to 10% if the sub-base is
            rough or you&apos;re working alone.

            A driveway apron or garage approach is one of the most common small

            So you need 71 × 80 lb bags for this job — roughly 1.5–2 pallets
            depending on the store. That&apos;s a manageable hand-mix, though at
            this size a rented electric mixer saves significant time and produces a
            more consistent result.

            All three bag sizes contain the same mix — the difference is just how much
            is in each bag. Heavier bags mean fewer trips and less tearing open
            packaging, but they&apos;re harder to lift, especially after a few hours

                a: "An 80 lb bag covers approximately 0.022 cubic yards, so you need about 45–46 bags per yard of plain volume. With a 5% waste buffer that becomes 48 bags.",
              },
              {
                q: "How do I convert inches to feet for the thickness?",
                a: "Divide the inch value by 12. A 4-inch slab is 4 ÷ 12 = 0.333 feet. A 6-inch slab is 0.5 feet. The calculator does this conversion automatically — just enter the thickness in inches.",
              },
              {
                q: "What is the difference between 40 lb, 60 lb, and 80 lb bags?",
                a: "Only the amount of mix in each bag. A 40 lb bag yields about 0.011 cu yd, a 60 lb bag 0.017 cu yd, and an 80 lb bag 0.022 cu yd. Heavier bags cost less per yard but are harder to handle over long jobs.",

              {
                q: "Why does this calculator use a different yield than another tool I found?",
                a: "Bag yields vary slightly by manufacturer and mix type. This calculator uses standard Quikrete/Sakrete averages. If your specific product has a different yield, use the volume output and divide manually.",
              },
              {
                q: "When should I use bags instead of ordering ready-mix?",
                a: "Bags make sense for pours under 1.5–2 cubic yards, for jobs where access is tight, or where you want to work in stages. Above that threshold, a ready-mix truck is usually cheaper and faster.",
              },
              {
                q: "Why add a waste factor if I&apos;m using exact measurements?",
                a: "Even with perfect measurements, some concrete is always lost — it sticks to mixer blades, fills small voids in the sub-base, and spills during placing. A 5% buffer is minimal insurance against running short.",
