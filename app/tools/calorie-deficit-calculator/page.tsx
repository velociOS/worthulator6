const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How many calories should I cut to lose weight?",
    a: "A 3,500 calorie deficit equals approximately 1 lb of fat loss. To lose 1 lb/week, cut 500 calories/day. To lose 2 lb/week, cut 1,000 calories/day. Most health experts recommend losing no more than 1–2 lbs per week for sustainable results.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 3,500 calorie rule for weight loss?",
    a: "The traditional rule states that 1 pound of fat stores 3,500 calories. Creating a 500-calorie daily deficit will lose 1 lb per week. While the math is slightly simplified (actual fat loss varies), it's a reliable planning tool for most people.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a safe daily calorie deficit?",
    a: "Generally, 500–1,000 calories/day is safe for most adults. Going below 1,200 calories/day for women or 1,500 for men is not recommended without medical supervision — it can trigger muscle loss, metabolic adaptation, and nutritional deficiencies.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know my maintenance calories?",
    a: "A rough estimate: multiply your weight in pounds by 15 for sedentary people, 17 for moderately active, 20 for very active. For a more accurate baseline, use a full TDEE calculator. This calculator uses 15× as a conservative baseline to estimate maintenance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I stop losing weight even at a deficit?",
    a: "Your body adapts. Metabolic rate decreases as you lose weight (you weigh less, so you burn less), and hormonal changes reduce energy expenditure. This is called metabolic adaptation. Refeed days, adjusting calories every 5–10 lbs lost, and strength training help maintain progress.",

    title: "Deficit is just the math — adherence is everything",
    body: "A 500-calorie deficit that you maintain is better than a 1,000-calorie deficit you abandon after 2 weeks. Hunger, social eating, and weekend variance all erode the calculated deficit. Track honestly and adjust based on real results every 2–3 weeks.",

    icon: "💪",
    title: "Protein protects muscle during fat loss",
