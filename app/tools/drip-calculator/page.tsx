  {
    q: "What is DRIP investing?",
    a:
      "DRIP stands for Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Instead of receiving dividends as cash, you automatically use them to buy more shares. This creates a compounding effect where each new share generates its own future dividends.",
  },
  {
    q: "What dividend yield should I use?",
    a:
      "The S&P 500 currently yields ~1.3–1.5%. Individual dividend stocks typically yield 2–5%, while high-yield dividend ETFs (like SCHD or VYM) yield 3–4%. REITs can yield 4–8%. Use the actual yield of the investment you're modeling.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between dividend yield and price growth?",
    a:
      "Dividend yield is the annual cash payment as a percentage of share price. Price growth is the appreciation in the share price itself. Total return combines both. This calculator lets you set each independently for accuracy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is dividend investing better than growth investing?",
    a:
      "Not necessarily — total return matters most. A dividend stock returning 3% yield + 5% price growth equals 8% total return, roughly matching a growth stock at 8% appreciation with no dividend. The advantage of dividends is the reliable income stream.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often are dividends paid?",
    a:
      "Most US stocks pay dividends quarterly. Some pay monthly (many REITs and bond funds). A few pay annually. For compounding purposes, more frequent payments accelerate growth slightly — this calculator assumes annual compounding for simplicity.",
  },
