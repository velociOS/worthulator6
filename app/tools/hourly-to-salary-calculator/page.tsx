            How does the hourly to salary calculation work?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            The conversion is straightforward: multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you work each week, then multiply by the number of weeks you work in a year.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            For example, if you earn $25 per hour and work 40 hours a week, your annual salary works out to $25 × 40 × 52 — which is $52,000. If you only work 50 weeks a year after taking two weeks of unpaid leave, that same rate gives you $50,000 instead. The difference adds up quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            You can adjust both your weekly hours and the number of weeks you work in the calculator above. Most tools assume 52 weeks and 40 hours — this one lets you be more precise.

          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            Someone earning around $15 per hour at full-time hours typically brings in just over $30,000 per year — a figure that comes up frequently in discussions around minimum wage and entry-level roles. A $20 hourly rate works out to roughly $41,600, while $25 an hour lands at $52,000 annually.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            As hourly rates climb, the annual numbers grow quickly. At $35 per hour, a full-time worker earns around $72,800 per year. Rates of $40 or $50 an hour — common in skilled trades, nursing, or consulting — translate to $83,200 and $104,000 respectively. At $75 or more, annual income moves comfortably into the six-figure range.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            These are all gross figures — before federal tax, state income tax, and payroll deductions. The amount that actually lands in your bank account will be lower depending on where you live and how you file.

          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            The annual figure shown is your gross income — what you earn before any taxes are taken out. In the US, several things reduce that number before it reaches your account.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            Federal income tax uses a progressive bracket system, starting at 10% on the lowest earnings and rising to 37% at the highest incomes. Most people earning between $40,000 and $80,000 have an effective federal rate well below their marginal rate, because only earnings above each threshold are taxed at the higher rate.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
            On top of that, payroll taxes cover Social Security (6.2% up to $168,600) and Medicare (1.45% with no ceiling). These apply regardless of income level or filing status. State income tax varies widely — from 0% in Texas and Florida to over 13% in California.
