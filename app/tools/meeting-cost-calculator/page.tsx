const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you calculate the cost of a meeting?",
    a: "Multiply the number of attendees by the average hourly wage by the duration in hours. An 8-person meeting at $50/hour average for 1 hour costs $400. This calculator does that instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use salary or loaded cost for the hourly rate?",
    a: "Loaded cost (salary + benefits + overhead) is more accurate for the true cost to the company. Benefits and overhead typically add 30–50% to base salary. Use loaded cost for business decisions, base salary for team conversations.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many hours per year do office workers spend in meetings?",
    a: "Studies consistently show 4–6 hours per week for average employees, and up to 23 hours per week for senior managers. At a fully-loaded rate of $75/hour, that's $300–1,700/week per person — just in meetings.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I make meetings cost less?",
    a: "Three levers: fewer attendees (every person added multiplies cost), shorter duration (stand-up meetings achieve more in 15 min than most hour-long calls), and higher-quality preparation (an agenda reduces meeting duration by an average of 20 minutes).",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a meeting ROI and how do I calculate it?",
    a: "Meeting ROI = (Value Generated − Meeting Cost) ÷ Meeting Cost. A $400 meeting that produces a decision saving $5,000 has an ROI of 1,150%. A $400 meeting that produces a follow-up meeting has a negative ROI. The problem is most teams never measure it.",
