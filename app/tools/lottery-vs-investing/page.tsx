  { q: "What are the actual odds of winning the lottery?", a: "Powerball jackpot odds: 1 in 292 million. Mega Millions: 1 in 302 million. You're more likely to be struck by lightning twice. The expected value of a $2 Powerball ticket is roughly $0.35." },
  { q: "How much do Americans spend on lottery tickets?", a: "Americans spend over $105 billion on lottery tickets per year — more than on movies, video games, and books combined. The average household spends about $1,000 per year on tickets." },
  { q: "Is the lottery a tax on people who can't do math?", a: "It's a reductive framing, but the math is brutal. State lotteries typically return only 50–60 cents per dollar wagered. In contrast, low-cost index funds average 7%+ annually over long periods." },
  { q: "What's the lump sum vs annuity trade-off?", a: "The lump sum is typically ~60% of the advertised jackpot. After federal taxes (37%) and state taxes, a $100M jackpot might net ~$29M as a lump sum — a significant reduction from the headline number." },
  { q: "Are there any arguments for playing?", a: "Entertainment value and the fantasy of 'what if.' Playing $2 occasionally for the psychological enjoyment of imagining a win isn't irrational. The problem is when it becomes a regular habit or a financial strategy." },
