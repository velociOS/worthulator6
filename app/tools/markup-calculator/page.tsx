const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is markup?",
    a: "Markup is the percentage you add to your cost price to determine your selling price. A 50% markup on a $100 item means you add $50, selling it for $150. It's calculated as (profit ÷ cost) × 100.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between markup and margin?",
    a: "Markup is profit as a percentage of cost. Margin is profit as a percentage of selling price. A 50% markup = 33.3% margin. A 100% markup = 50% margin. They describe the same profit — just from different perspectives.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a standard markup percentage?",
    a: "It varies by industry. Retail clothing: 100–300%. Grocery: 15–25%. Restaurants: 200–400% on food. Software: 80–90%+ gross margin. Electronics: 10–30%. There's no universal 'right' markup — it depends on your market and costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I convert markup to margin?",
    a: "Margin = Markup ÷ (1 + Markup). So a 50% markup = 50 ÷ 150 = 33.3% margin. A 100% markup = 100 ÷ 200 = 50% margin. This calculator shows both so you never have to convert manually.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use markup or margin to price my products?",
    a: "Either works, but margin is generally preferred in finance and accounting because it shows profitability relative to revenue. Markup is useful for quickly setting prices from cost. Know both and use whichever your industry favours.",

    title: "The keystone markup rule",
    body: "Many retailers use a 'keystone' markup of 100% — doubling the wholesale cost to get the retail price. This produces a 50% gross margin and has been a retail rule of thumb for decades, though competitive pricing pressure often forces lower markups.",

    icon: "🧮",
    title: "Why the math trips people up",
    body: "A common mistake: setting a 30% markup thinking you have a 30% margin. You don't — you have a 23% margin. Always calculate both and know which one your pricing model targets. Use this calculator to check before setting prices.",

    icon: "📈",
    title: "Margins compound through the supply chain",
    body: "Every step in a supply chain takes a markup. A product that costs $10 to make may be marked up 100% to $20 by the manufacturer, then 50% to $30 by the distributor, then 100% to $60 at retail. Understanding each margin helps you negotiate.",
