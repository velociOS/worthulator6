const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does the average person save working from home?",
    a: "Studies estimate remote workers save $600–$6,000 per year depending on their commute length, location, and spending habits. The biggest savings come from commuting costs, bought lunches, and work clothing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What costs are included in this calculation?",
    a: "This calculator covers daily commute costs (fuel, public transport, parking) and daily food and coffee costs at or near the office. It does not include clothing savings, gym memberships, or home office setup costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the calculator account for higher home utility bills?",
    a: "Not in this version. Remote workers typically see higher electricity and heating bills, which can offset some savings — usually $200–$500/year depending on the home. Subtract this from your result for a more precise figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is time saved calculated?",
    a: "The calculator doubles your one-way commute time (round trip) and multiplies by office days per week and 52 weeks per year. This is the raw time you reclaim — not accounting for how you choose to use it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use this to justify a pay cut for a remote role?",
    a: "Yes — remote roles sometimes offer lower base salaries. Use this calculator to see how much your take-home lifestyle improves even with a modest pay reduction, once commuting, food, and clothing costs are removed.",
