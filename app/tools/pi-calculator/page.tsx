                Personal injury settlements and verdicts reflect two primary
                damage categories: <strong>economic</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>non-economic</strong>. Economic damages include
                documented financial losses such as medical bills, lost wages,
                and future care costs. Non-economic damages — often called
                "pain and suffering" — are harder to quantify and typically
                calculated using a multiplier applied to economic damages based
                on severity, recovery duration, and impact on life.

                A <strong>conservative estimate</strong> reflects what an early
                settlement might look like — where the insurer has maximum
                leverage and you accept quickly. The{" "}
                <strong>likely settlement</strong> reflects a well-documented
                claim negotiated with legal representation. The{" "}
                <strong>aggressive / trial value</strong> represents a favorable
                jury verdict where all damages are maximised — statistically
                achieved in a small percentage of cases that go to trial.
