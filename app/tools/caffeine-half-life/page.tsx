const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the half-life of caffeine?",
    a:
      "Caffeine's half-life in healthy adults is approximately 5–6 hours. This means that 5 hours after drinking coffee, about half the caffeine remains active. After 10 hours, about 25% remains. Individual metabolism, pregnancy, medications, and liver function can shift this significantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much caffeine is in a cup of coffee?",
    a:
      "A standard 8oz brewed coffee contains approximately 80–100mg of caffeine, with 95mg as the widely cited average. Espresso shots contain ~63mg. Energy drinks range from 80–300mg. This calculator uses 95mg per standard cup.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much caffeine is OK to have at bedtime?",
    a:
      "Research suggests that having more than 50mg of caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep quality and reduce total sleep time. Below 10–15mg is generally considered functionally cleared. Even if you fall asleep, caffeine can suppress deep (slow-wave) sleep.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best time to stop drinking coffee?",
    a:
      "For most people with an 11pm bedtime, the ideal cutoff is around 1–2pm. For earlier bedtimes (10pm), stop by noon. The exact time depends on how many cups you drink and your personal caffeine metabolism speed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does caffeine affect sleep even if I fall asleep fine?",
    a:
      "Yes — caffeine can reduce slow-wave (deep) sleep even when you don't notice it. This leads to feeling less rested despite sleeping 7–8 hours. Many chronic coffee drinkers don't realise their afternoon coffees are affecting sleep quality.",

    title: "The 6-hour rule",
    body: "A commonly cited guideline: avoid caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime. Research by Dr. Christopher Drake found that caffeine consumed 6 hours before bed still reduced total sleep time by about 1 hour, even in people who felt they fell asleep without issue.",

    title: "Why afternoon coffee hurts your sleep",
    body: "With a 5-hour half-life, a 3pm coffee still has 50% of its caffeine active at 8pm, and 25% active at 1am. If you drink multiple cups throughout the day, the caffeine levels compound and stay elevated well into the night.",

    icon: "🧬",
    title: "Caffeine sensitivity varies widely",
    body: "Some people metabolise caffeine quickly (fast metabolisers — CYP1A2 gene variant) and can drink coffee late with little effect. Slow metabolisers may feel stimulated 8–10 hours later. Hormonal contraceptives, certain antibiotics, and liver conditions also slow caffeine clearance.",
