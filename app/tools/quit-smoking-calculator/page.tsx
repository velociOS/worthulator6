const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much money do you save by quitting smoking?",
    a: "At 1 pack/day and $10/pack, quitting saves $3,650/year. After 10 years, that's $36,500 — not counting investment growth. In a high-cost state like New York ($14/pack), one-pack-a-day smokers save over $5,000/year.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many cigarettes do you avoid by quitting?",
    a: "A standard pack has 20 cigarettes. At 1 pack/day, you avoid 20 cigarettes per day, 7,300 per year, 73,000 in a decade. Each cigarette takes an estimated 11 minutes off your life — so that's 800+ hours of life regained per year.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 'days of life regained' calculation?",
    a: "Research suggests each cigarette shortens life by about 11 minutes. This calculator multiplies cigarettes avoided by 11 minutes and converts to days. It's an estimate based on population averages, not a personal health guarantee.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do cravings stop after quitting?",
    a: "Most acute cravings peak in the first 72 hours and diminish significantly by 2–4 weeks. Nicotine is physically cleared from your system within 3–4 days. Psychological habit triggers can persist for months, but each craving episode typically passes in 3–5 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take for health to improve after quitting?",
    a: "20 minutes: blood pressure normalizes. 24 hours: carbon monoxide clears from blood. 2 weeks: circulation and lung function improve. 1 year: heart disease risk is halved. 10 years: lung cancer risk drops to roughly half that of a current smoker. The benefits start immediately.",
