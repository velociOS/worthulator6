const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does the average commute cost per year?",
    a: "The average US commuter drives about 30 miles round trip per day. At 28 MPG and $3.50/gallon, that's about $1,340/year in fuel alone. Add wear and tear ($0.08–0.12/mile), insurance, and parking, and total commute costs often exceed $3,000–5,000/year.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this calculator include wear and tear?",
    a: "No — this calculator covers fuel costs only. The IRS standard mileage rate (67 cents/mile in 2024) is a comprehensive estimate that includes fuel, oil, tires, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. Multiply your annual miles by ~$0.10–0.12 for wear and tear alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate my commute cost per day?",
    a: "Round trip miles ÷ MPG × gas price = daily fuel cost. For 30 miles round trip at 28 MPG and $3.50/gallon: 30 ÷ 28 × $3.50 = $3.75/day. Over 250 work days, that's $937.50/year in fuel.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it cheaper to take public transit?",
    a: "In most US cities, yes. A monthly transit pass ($50–150) is almost always cheaper than driving. But factor in time — public transit often takes 1.5–2× longer each way. Assign a dollar value to your time and include it in the comparison.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does remote work affect commute cost?",
    a: "Dramatically. One remote day per week saves 20% of annual commute costs. Two days saves 40%. Many workers who switched to hybrid work during 2020–2023 saved $1,500–3,000/year in commuting costs alone — not counting wear on the car or reclaimed time.",

    title: "Commute vs higher rent",
    body: "Living closer to work costs more in rent — but a 30-minute shorter commute saves 125 hours/year. Only you can decide what your time is worth, but for many workers an extra $200–300/month in rent to halve their commute is easily worth it.",
