const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does my commute reduce my effective hourly rate?",
    a: "Your employer pays you for 2,080 hours per year, but your commute adds unpaid hours on top. If you commute 45 minutes each way and work 235 days, that's 352 extra unpaid hours annually. Your effective rate = (annual salary) ÷ (2,080 + commute hours). For a $35/hr worker, a 45-min commute drops the effective rate to around $29/hr.",
  },
  {
    q: "What percentage of salary does the average commute consume?",
    a: "For a 45-minute daily commute at the US median wage, roughly 8–12% of gross salary value is lost to unpaid commuting time. For lower-wage workers with long commutes this can exceed 20%, effectively pricing them out of certain job markets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include commute time when comparing job offers?",
    a: "Absolutely. A job paying $5,000 more but requiring an extra 30 minutes each way (235 work days) adds 188 hours of unpaid time annually. At $30/hr that's $5,640 in time value — meaning the higher-paying job actually pays less once commute is factored in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you calculate the dollar value of commute time?",
    a: "Annual commute hours × hourly wage = value of time lost. The logic: you could be doing something productive with that time. Even at half your work rate, the cost is substantial. Most people dramatically underestimate it until they see it calculated.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does working from home solve the commute cost problem?",
    a: "Fully remote eliminates commute time cost entirely — effectively giving you a raise equal to your commute's time value. One remote day per week reduces the annual cost by 20%. This is why remote work offers with lower stated salaries often have higher real compensation than office roles.",

    body: "Your employer pays for 8 hours per day. But if you add a 1-hour commute, you're actually giving 9 hours of your day to that job. Your true hourly rate is your salary divided by all hours given — including transit. For many workers, this is a 10–15% effective pay cut hiding in plain sight.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔄",
    title: "Use it to negotiate or choose offers",
    body: "When comparing two job offers, calculate the effective hourly rate for both including commute. A downtown job paying $75k with a 60-min commute can easily pay less per real hour than a suburban job at $68k with a 15-min commute — especially when childcare, fuel, and parking are added.",

    icon: "🏡",
    title: "The rent vs commute trade-off",
    body: "Paying $400/month more in rent to halve your commute sounds expensive. But if halving your commute saves $6,000/year in time value, that's a $1,200/year net gain — plus the reclaimed mental bandwidth and reduced stress. The maths of proximity usually favours paying more to live closer.",
