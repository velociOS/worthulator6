const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is net worth and how is it calculated?",
    a: "Net worth = Total assets − Total liabilities. Assets are everything you own (cash, investments, property, vehicles). Liabilities are everything you owe (mortgage, car loans, student loans, credit card debt). A positive net worth means your assets exceed your debts.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good net worth by age?",
    a: "A common benchmark is to have a net worth equal to your annual salary by age 30, 3× your salary by 40, 6× by 50, and 8× by 60. However, these are rough guides — location, career, and starting point all vary enormously. The most important metric is consistent growth from wherever you start.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include my home value in net worth?",
    a: "Yes and no. Including your primary home inflates your net worth but overstates your liquid wealth — you can't easily spend home equity without selling or refinancing. Many financial planners calculate both an 'including primary home' and 'excluding primary home' net worth. This calculator includes it, but you can set home value to $0 to see your investable net worth.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I calculate my net worth?",
    a: "Quarterly is a good cadence for most people. Checking too frequently leads to emotional decision-making based on short-term fluctuations. Annual tracking at minimum aligns well with tax season and major financial review periods.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the debt-to-asset ratio?",
    a: "Your debt-to-asset ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets. A ratio below 50% means more than half of your assets are equity. Above 80% is considered high risk. Most mortgage lenders won't approve a DTI (debt-to-income) ratio above 43%. The lower the ratio, the stronger your financial position.",
