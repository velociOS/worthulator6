const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much does Facebook earn per user?", a: "Meta's Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) in the US and Canada is approximately $200–$250 per year. This comes almost entirely from advertising revenue powered by your behavioural data." },
  { q: "What data do companies collect?", a: "Browsing history, location, purchase behaviour, friend networks, communication patterns, emotional reactions (what you linger on), physical health data, and in some cases biometric data. The profiles are extraordinarily detailed." },
  { q: "Can I actually get paid for my data?", a: "A small number of apps like Nielsen Computer Panel, Data Wallet, and Killi pay small amounts for data sharing. The value is real but modest — you'd earn far less than companies earn from you." },
  { q: "What is the data broker industry?", a: "Hundreds of companies (Acxiom, Experian, Oracle) buy, aggregate, and sell personal data. They know where you live, what you earn, your health conditions, political views, and buying habits — all legally." },
  { q: "How do I reduce my data footprint?", a: "Use a VPN, browser privacy settings, opt out of ad tracking (iOS settings), use Signal instead of SMS, DuckDuckGo instead of Google, and regularly audit app permissions. Nothing eliminates it but each step helps." },

  { icon: "📊", title: "Data compounds over time", body: "Unlike other commodities, data about you becomes more valuable as it accumulates. A year of location data is more valuable than a day. A decade of purchase history is vastly more valuable than a month. Your profile only deepens." },
