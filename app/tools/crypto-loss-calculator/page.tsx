const FAQS = [
  { q: "How do I calculate my true crypto P&L?", a: "True P&L = current portfolio value − total invested (cost basis). Don't forget to include transaction fees, gas costs, and any taxable events along the way — they reduce your real return." },
  { q: "Are crypto losses tax deductible?", a: "In the US, crypto losses can be used to offset capital gains from other investments. Unused losses of up to $3,000 can offset ordinary income per year, with excess carrying forward." },
  { q: "Is the S&P 500 comparison fair?", a: "It's the most common benchmark for opportunity cost. The S&P 500 has averaged about 10% nominally (7% inflation-adjusted) over long periods. It's the right baseline for 'what else could this money have done?'" },
  { q: "What's the most common crypto investing mistake?", a: "Buying high (FOMO) and selling low (panic) — the classic cycle. Most retail crypto investors underperform simply because they trade emotionally at peak euphoria and trough despair." },
  { q: "Should I sell crypto losses before year-end?", a: "Tax-loss harvesting — selling losses to offset gains — can be valuable. Unlike stocks, there's no wash-sale rule for crypto (as of 2024), so you can immediately rebuy the same asset after selling for a loss." },
