const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is TDEE?",
    a:
      "TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including your basal metabolic rate (BMR) plus all physical activity. Eating at your TDEE maintains your weight. Eating below loses weight; above gains weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Mifflin-St Jeor formula?",
    a:
      "The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is currently the most accurate formula for estimating BMR for most people. For men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age + 5. For women: same but −161 instead of +5. TDEE = BMR × activity multiplier.",
  },
  {
    q: "What activity multiplier should I use?",
    a:
      "Sedentary (desk job, little exercise) = 1.2. Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week) = 1.375. Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week) = 1.55. Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week) = 1.725. Extra active (physical job + daily exercise) = 1.9. Most people overestimate their activity level.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many calories should I cut to lose weight?",
    a:
      "A deficit of 500 calories/day leads to approximately 1 lb of fat loss per week (3,500 cal = 1 lb). A 250–500 cal deficit is considered sustainable. Cutting more than 1,000 cal/day often leads to muscle loss and metabolic adaptation. Start with a 20% deficit from TDEE.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does TDEE vary between calculators?",
    a:
      "TDEE calculators use different formulas (Mifflin-St Jeor, Harris-Benedict, Katch-McArdle) and different activity multipliers. Mifflin-St Jeor is preferred because it was validated in a 2005 systematic review as the most accurate for the general population.",

    title: "Maintenance calories are your baseline",
    body: "Your TDEE is the exact number of calories needed to maintain your current weight. This is your most important number for any diet goal. Eat 10–20% below for fat loss. Eat 5–10% above for muscle gain. Track relative to this — not some generic 2,000-calorie recommendation.",

  {
    icon: "🏃",
    title: "Activity level is the biggest variable",
    body: "The activity multiplier can swing your TDEE by 500–1,000+ calories. Most people who sit at a desk all day and exercise 3× per week fall in the 1.375–1.55 range. Overestimating activity is the #1 reason calorie tracking 'doesn't work.'",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔄",
    title: "TDEE changes as you lose weight",
    body: "As you lose weight, your BMR decreases — you're burning fewer calories at rest. This is why weight loss often stalls after initial progress. Recalculate your TDEE every 4–6 weeks as your weight changes to keep your calorie targets accurate.",
