const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does a savings account grow?",
    a: "Savings accounts grow through interest — the bank pays you a percentage of your balance periodically. With compound interest, that interest is added to your balance and then earns interest itself, accelerating growth over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good interest rate for a savings account?",
    a: "Traditional savings accounts often pay 0.5–1%. High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) — typically offered by online banks — often pay 4–5% or more. Even a small rate difference compounds into thousands of dollars over a decade.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I save each month?",
    a: "A common benchmark is the 50/30/20 rule — save 20% of your take-home pay. But any consistent amount helps. Even $50/month at 4.5% interest grows to over $7,500 in 10 years — all from habit, not a windfall.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I have in an emergency fund?",
    a: "Most financial experts recommend 3–6 months of living expenses. If your monthly expenses are $3,000, aim for $9,000–$18,000 in an accessible, liquid savings account before allocating money to longer-term investments.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does compound frequency matter?",
    a: "Yes, but the difference is smaller than most people expect. Monthly compounding vs. annual compounding on the same rate makes a meaningful difference only over very long periods. The rate itself and your contribution consistency matter far more.",
  },
