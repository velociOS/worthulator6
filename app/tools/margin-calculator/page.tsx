            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">How to calculate profit margin</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Profit margin is the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after subtracting the cost of producing or purchasing an item. It is one of the most fundamental metrics in business — a high margin means you keep more of each sale; a low margin means you need volume to be profitable.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              The formula is straightforward: <strong>Margin = (Selling Price − Cost) ÷ Selling Price × 100</strong>. If you buy a product for $30 and sell it for $50, your gross profit is $20 and your margin is 40%. That $20 is 40% of the $50 selling price.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Margin is calculated against the selling price — this is what makes it different from markup, which measures profit as a percentage of cost. The distinction matters because quoting a 50% markup to a customer sounds very different from a 33% margin, even though they describe the exact same transaction.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">Pricing strategy and margin management</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Understanding your margin is only the first step. Managing it strategically is what separates profitable businesses from ones that stay perpetually busy but never build wealth. There are two levers for improving margin: increasing price or reducing cost.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Raising prices is often more effective than it seems. A 5% price increase on a product with a 20% margin actually increases the profit per unit by 25%. But price sensitivity matters — the margin sensitivity chart in the calculator above shows exactly what happens to your margin at various price points, helping you find the sweet spot between volume and profitability.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Reducing cost — through supplier negotiation, volume discounts, or process improvements — has the same arithmetic effect. A $2 reduction in cost on a $20 product improves your margin from, say, 30% to 40%. Over thousands of units, that is significant. This is why businesses obsess over cost of goods sold (COGS) as they scale.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">Why a thin margin is dangerous</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              A margin below 10% leaves almost no buffer for unexpected costs — a supplier price increase, a batch of returns, higher shipping fees, or a marketplace fee change can all push a thin-margin product negative. Many businesses have discovered too late that their bestseller was actually costing them money once all costs were properly accounted for.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              This is why &ldquo;gross margin&rdquo; calculated on cost alone can be misleading. True profitability requires accounting for fulfilment costs, payment processing fees (typically 1.5–3%), return rates, storage, and marketing. A 20% gross margin can easily compress to 5–8% once these are included, which is why knowing your fully-loaded margin is essential before scaling.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">Margin by business model</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              The right margin target depends entirely on your business model. A physical retailer with rent, staff, and inventory carrying costs needs a higher gross margin — typically 40–60% — just to break even on operating expenses. An eCommerce business with lower overheads can operate profitably on 25–35%.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Software companies are the anomaly. Once the product is built, the marginal cost of delivering it to an additional customer is near zero. This is why SaaS companies report gross margins of 70–85% — there is no cost of goods in the traditional sense, only hosting and support.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              For freelancers and service businesses, &ldquo;cost&rdquo; is primarily your time. If you charge $500 for a day&apos;s work and your effective hourly cost (including tools, admin, and downtime) is $80, your margin is 84%. Service businesses can command very high margins when expertise is scarce — and very low ones when competition is fierce and switching costs are low.
