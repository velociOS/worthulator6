  {
    q: "How long does it take for solar panels to pay for themselves?",
    a:
      "The average US solar payback period is 6–12 years. With a $20,000 system, $150/month electricity bill, 85% solar offset, and 3% annual utility inflation, you typically break even in around 8–10 years. After that, electricity savings are essentially free profit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is solar offset percentage?",
    a:
      "Solar offset is the percentage of your electricity use covered by your solar panels. A 100% offset means your panels generate as much electricity as you consume on an annual basis. Most residential systems aim for 80–100% offset, but actual production varies by season.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the federal solar tax credit apply?",
    a:
      "Yes — the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) currently offers a 30% credit on the total cost of a solar installation. A $20,000 system qualifies for a $6,000 credit, reducing your net cost to $14,000. This dramatically shortens the payback period. Check IRS Form 5695.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does utility rate inflation affect solar ROI?",
    a:
      "Historically, US electricity rates have risen about 2–4% per year. As your utility rate rises, the value of the electricity your panels generate increases each year. A 3% annual increase on $150/month means you'd be paying ~$202/month in 10 years without solar — making your panels increasingly valuable over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the lifespan of solar panels?",
    a:
      "Most solar panels are warrantied for 25–30 years and typically degrade about 0.5% per year in efficiency. After 25 years, a panel might produce about 87% of its original output. This calculator uses a 25-year window for long-term savings projections.",
