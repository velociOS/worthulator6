const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate fuel cost for a road trip?",
    a: "Fuel Cost = (Distance / MPG) × Gas Price Per Gallon. For a 300-mile trip at 30 MPG with gas at $3.50/gal: 300 / 30 = 10 gallons × $3.50 = $35 one way, $70 round trip. This calculator does the math instantly for any combination of values.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a realistic MPG for road trips?",
    a: "Highway driving is more efficient than city driving — most cars get 10–20% better MPG on the highway than their combined EPA rating. Check your car's specific EPA highway rating at fueleconomy.gov. For a rough estimate, use your combined rating; for a more accurate result, use your highway MPG.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find the current gas price in my area?",
    a: "GasBuddy.com and the GasBuddy app show current prices by zip code and gas station. The AAA national average is updated daily and is a good proxy if you're estimating for a multi-state trip. You can also check Google Maps — it shows gas prices at stations along your route.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the calculator round-trip by default?",
    a: "Most road trips are return journeys. The calculator shows one-way fuel cost separately so you can plan for trips where you won't be driving back (e.g. moving, one-way flights). The per-person cost is based on the round-trip total, divided evenly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What other costs should I budget for a road trip?",
    a: "Fuel is typically 30–40% of road trip costs. Other major expenses: accommodation ($80–$200/night), food ($30–$60/person/day), tolls, and parking. Electric vehicle drivers should budget for charging stops and time, which varies significantly by route and charging infrastructure.",

    body: "Long highway drives are more fuel-efficient than city driving. If your car's combined EPA rating is 30 MPG, your highway MPG is likely 32–36 MPG. Use the highway figure for an accurate road trip estimate — otherwise you'll overestimate your fuel spend.",

    title: "Carpooling is a massive cost multiplier",
    body: "Driving solo costs $70 in fuel for a 300-mile round trip at 30 MPG and $3.50/gal. With 4 people, each person pays $17.50. The per-person cost drops almost four-fold for the same trip. This is why carpooling is one of the most impactful transport cost savings available.",

    icon: "🗺️",
    title: "Fuel is only 30–40% of road trip costs",
