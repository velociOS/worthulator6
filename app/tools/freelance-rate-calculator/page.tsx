const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate my freelance hourly rate?",
    a: "Start with your desired annual take-home income. Add taxes (self-employment tax ~15.3% + income tax), business expenses (software, equipment, insurance, accountant), and a profit margin buffer. Divide the total by your billable hours per year. Most freelancers work 1,200–1,500 billable hours per year (not 2,080 like a salaried employee).",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is my freelance rate so much higher than an employee salary equivalent?",
    a: "Because freelancers pay 100% of their own taxes (including the employer's half of Social Security and Medicare), fund their own health insurance, retirement savings, equipment, and have no paid vacation. A $100k freelance rate is not equivalent to a $100k salary — it's significantly less after all self-employment costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What billable hours should I use?",
    a: "Be realistic. Of a 40-hour week, typical freelancers bill 20–30 hours — the rest goes to admin, sales, client communication, and non-billable work. Factor in time off: 4–8 weeks per year is normal (holidays, sick leave, gaps between projects). Using too-optimistic hours leads to undercharging.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I charge hourly or use project rates?",
    a: "Most experienced freelancers recommend project-based pricing because it rewards efficiency and removes the incentive to slow down. However, the hourly rate calculation is still essential: it tells you the minimum revenue you need from every project regardless of how you structure the billing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if clients say my rate is too high?",
    a: "That means you're talking to the wrong clients, not that your rate is wrong. Your minimum viable rate is the number below which you literally cannot hit your income goals. Charging less doesn't make you more affordable — it makes you financially stressed and resentful, which clients can feel.",

    icon: "🧾",
    title: "Don't forget self-employment tax",
    body: "As a freelancer, you pay both the employee (7.65%) AND employer (7.65%) portions of Social Security and Medicare — totalling ~15.3%. Add income tax on top and your effective rate can be 30–40%. Failing to account for this is why so many freelancers end up surprised at tax time.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📅",
    title: "Billable hours ≠ working hours",
    body: "Every hour you spend on admin, invoicing, sales, proposals, and communication is an hour you're NOT billing. For most freelancers, 25–30 billable hours per week out of 40 worked is realistic. A 1,400 billable hour year is typical. Assuming 2,000 billable hours leads to chronic undercharging.",
