const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a good pay raise percentage?",
    a: "In 2026, a cost-of-living raise typically runs 3–4%. A merit raise for solid performance is 5–7%. Exceptional performers or employees changing roles can negotiate 10–20%. Anything below inflation effectively means a pay cut in real terms.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate a pay raise?",
    a: "Multiply your current salary by (1 + raise% ÷ 100). A 5% raise on $65,000 = $65,000 × 1.05 = $68,250. Your increase is $3,250 per year, or about $271 per month.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I negotiate my raise?",
    a: "Yes — always. Most managers expect negotiation. Research your market rate using Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, or Levels.fyi. Come with data, not just a request. The worst they can say is no.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does inflation affect my raise?",
    a: "A 3% raise during 4% inflation means your purchasing power actually decreased by 1%. To get a real raise, your percentage needs to exceed the current inflation rate. Use the inflation calculator to see the real value of your raise.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a raise and a promotion?",
    a: "A raise increases your pay in your current role. A promotion changes your role and typically comes with a larger increase (10–25%) plus new responsibilities. Promotions are one of the fastest ways to accelerate salary growth.",
