const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Where does the 'Life in Weeks' concept come from?",
    a: "Tim Urban of Wait But Why popularised this concept with his viral post 'Your Life in Weeks,' which showed a grid of 4,680 boxes representing a 90-year life — each box being one week. The visual impact of seeing a large portion already filled in is famously motivating.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the average life expectancy?",
    a: "Global average life expectancy is approximately 73 years. In the US it is around 77, in the UK 81, and in Japan 84. Use your country's average or a personal estimate based on family history and health.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why measure in weeks and not years?",
    a: "Weeks make the remaining time feel more concrete and actionable. A year feels abstract, but a week is something you live through every seven days. Seeing 2,600 weeks remaining (50 years) makes each individual week feel more tangible and worth using well.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this tool meant to be depressing?",
    a: "Quite the opposite. Research on mortality salience shows that confronting the finite nature of life consistently increases motivation, gratitude, and intentional action. Most users report feeling inspired rather than anxious after using this tool.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do with this information?",
    a: "There is no right answer — but many people use it to re-evaluate how they are spending their time: careers they have been putting off, relationships they have been neglecting, or travel they keep deferring. The goal is intentionality, not urgency.",
  },
