const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate business days between two dates?",
    a: "Count the total calendar days between the two dates, multiply by 5/7 to estimate weekdays (this approximates the proportion of weekdays in any period), then subtract any public holidays in that range. The formula: Working Days ≈ (Calendar Days × 5/7) − Holidays. For precise results, count each day manually or use a date-aware calendar tool.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts as a working day?",
    a: "A working day is typically Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays. Some industries (retail, healthcare, hospitality) operate on weekends, so their 'working days' may include Saturday and Sunday. For legal and contract purposes, 'business days' usually means weekdays excluding public bank holidays in the relevant jurisdiction.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many working days are in a year?",
    a: "In the US: 52 weeks × 5 days = 260 weekdays, minus 11 federal holidays = 249 working days. In the UK: 52 weeks × 5 days = 260 weekdays, minus 8 bank holidays in England/Wales = 252 working days. These figures don't account for company-specific holidays or leave.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does a deadline of '5 business days' actually fall?",
    a: "Count forward 5 weekdays from the start date, skipping weekends and public holidays. If a 5-business-day deadline starts on a Thursday, count: Friday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5) — arriving the following Thursday. Never count the start date itself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do Saturdays count as working days for legal notices?",
    a: "In most US jurisdictions, Saturdays do not count as business days for legal notice purposes unless specified. The FRCP (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays from computation of time periods. Always check the specific contract or statute — some explicitly define 'calendar days' vs 'business days' differently.",

    title: "Why the 5/7 formula works",
    body: "Any stretch of calendar days contains roughly 5/7 weekdays, because weeks are the fundamental unit of the work calendar. This approximation is accurate to within ±1 day for most ranges. For legal or contractual precision over short periods (under 2 weeks), count days manually to avoid the rounding error.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⚠️",
    title: "Public holidays vary by state and country",
    body: "Federal holidays apply to federal government employees, but private employers are not required to give time off. Each US state has additional holidays. Internationally, working calendars differ significantly — the UK, India, Germany, and Australia all have different holiday counts and dates. Always check your specific regional calendar.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📋",
    title: "Use working days for contract deadlines",
    body: "Contracts, legal notices, and SLAs typically specify deadlines in 'business days' rather than calendar days. Always confirm whether a deadline is calendar days or working days before calculating. Misreading this distinction is a common source of missed deadlines and disputes in commercial contracts.",
