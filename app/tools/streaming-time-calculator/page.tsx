  { q: "How much time does the average person spend streaming?", a: "Americans average about 4 hours of video content daily, up from 3.1 pre-pandemic. Over a year, that's 1,460 hours — or 60 full days — of streaming." },
  { q: "How much does streaming subscription cost per year?", a: "With Netflix ($15–22), Disney+ ($8–14), Hulu ($8–18), and HBO Max ($10–16), a full stack of popular services can run $600–$850/year at standard tiers." },
  { q: "Is watching TV actually bad for you?", a: "Sedentary behaviour in general has health risks. Research links excessive TV watching (4+ hrs/day) with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, depression, and poor sleep quality. The content matters less than the sitting." },
  { q: "How do I find out how much Netflix I've watched?", a: "Go to Netflix → Account → My Profile → Viewing Activity. You can see every title you've watched. Third-party tools can estimate total time from this list." },
  { q: "What would I do with all that time?", a: "1,460 hours per year is enough to learn a language (600 hrs to conversational), earn a pilot's licence (250 hrs), complete two college courses, read 72 books, or run 2,190 miles." },
