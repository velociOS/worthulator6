const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do lenders determine how much house I can afford?",
    a: "Most lenders use the 28/36 rule: your mortgage payment should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income, and total debt payments (mortgage + car + student loans) should not exceed 36%. This calculator uses the 28% front-end ratio as a baseline for the maximum home price.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is gross monthly income?",
    a: "Gross income is your income before taxes and deductions. If you earn $90,000/year, your gross monthly income is $7,500. For joint applicants (two incomes on the same mortgage), add both incomes together and enter the combined figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the calculator include property tax and insurance?",
    a: "No — this calculator uses your principal and interest payment only against the 28% income rule. In practice, lenders include property taxes, homeowners insurance, and PMI in the 28% calculation. This means your actual buying power may be 10–20% lower once those costs are factored in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does my down payment affect affordability?",
    a: "A larger down payment directly increases your maximum home price because it reduces the loan amount required. It also eliminates PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) when you put down 20% or more, which further lowers your monthly payment and increases affordability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy the maximum I can afford?",
    a: "Buying at the maximum of your affordability leaves no buffer for interest rate rises, job changes, or unexpected expenses. A common guideline is to target a home at 3–4× your annual gross income and keep your mortgage payment below 25% of take-home pay, not gross income.",

    title: "The 28% rule is a ceiling, not a target",
    body: "Lenders will often approve you up to 28–31% of gross income, but that does not mean you should spend that much. Buying at maximum affordability leaves no room for a rate rise, job loss, or major home repair. Most financial advisors recommend keeping your mortgage under 25% of net (take-home) income.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📉",
    title: "Rate changes have a huge impact",
    body: "A 1% rise in mortgage rates reduces your buying power by roughly 10%. At 6%, a $2,000/month budget buys about $333,000 in loan. At 7%, the same payment only supports $300,000. Run the calculator at your current rate and 1–2% higher to understand your rate sensitivity.",

  {
    icon: "💰",
    title: "Hidden costs beyond the mortgage",
    body: "Property taxes (0.5–2.5% of value per year), homeowners insurance ($1,200–$3,000/year), HOA fees, maintenance (budget 1% of home value annually), and closing costs (2–5%) all add to the true cost of homeownership. Factor these in before committing to a price point.",
