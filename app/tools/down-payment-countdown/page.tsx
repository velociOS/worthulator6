const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much down payment do I need to buy a house?",
    a:
      "It depends on the loan type. Conventional loans typically require 5–20% down. Putting 20% down avoids Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), which adds ~0.5–1.5%/year to your mortgage. FHA loans allow as little as 3.5% down with a credit score of 580+.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 20% down payment always best?",
    a:
      "Not necessarily. A 20% down payment eliminates PMI and gives you a lower monthly payment, but tying up a large sum in a house means you're not investing it elsewhere. With today's high home prices, many buyers opt for 5–10% down and accept PMI.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to save for a down payment?",
    a:
      "For a median-priced US home (~$400,000) with a 10% down payment, you'd need $40,000. Saving $1,000/month gets you there in ~40 months. Saving $1,500/month gets you there in ~27 months — plus any existing savings help.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I save in a HYSA for my down payment?",
    a:
      "Yes — a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) or money market account is ideal for down payment savings. It keeps your funds liquid, FDIC-insured, and earning 4–5% APY (as of 2025) while you save. Avoid the stock market for money you'll need in under 5 years.",
  },
  {
    q: "What other costs should I budget for beyond the down payment?",
    a:
      "Budget for closing costs (2–5% of loan amount), home inspection ($300–$500), appraisal ($400–$600), moving costs, and an emergency fund for immediate home repairs. Many buyers underestimate how much cash they need beyond just the down payment.",
