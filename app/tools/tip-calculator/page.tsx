const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much should you tip at a restaurant?",
    a: "In the US, 15–20% is standard for sit-down restaurants. 18% is considered the baseline for acceptable service, 20% for good service, and 25%+ for exceptional. Counter service and fast casual typically warrants 10–15% if you tip at all.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you calculate a tip quickly in your head?",
    a: "For 20%, move the decimal one place left (10%), then double it. On a $64 bill: 10% = $6.40, doubled = $12.80. For 15%, take 10% and add half — $6.40 + $3.20 = $9.60. Or just use this calculator.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should you tip on the pre-tax or post-tax amount?",
    a: "Tipping on the pre-tax amount is technically correct, but most people tip on the total. The difference is small — on a $60 bill with 8% tax, it's about $1 either way. Tip on whatever feels right.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you split a bill unequally?",
    a: "This calculator splits evenly. For unequal splits — where people ordered different items — use the bill total for each person individually and run the calculator separately, or note each person's share before tipping.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should you tip more than 20%?",
    a: "Tip above 20% for exceptional service, on very small bills (a $5 coffee still warrants $1–2), or when your group has caused extra work. It's also common to tip more during holidays as a thank-you to regular service workers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it rude to split a bill evenly if someone ordered more?",
    a: "It depends on the group. Among close friends, even splits are common and save awkwardness. In mixed company or with big price differences, itemised splits are fairer. Most important is agreeing before the bill arrives.",
