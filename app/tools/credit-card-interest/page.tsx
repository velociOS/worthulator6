const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How is credit card interest calculated?",
    a: "Credit card interest is calculated daily. Your APR is divided by 365 to get a daily rate, which is applied to your outstanding balance each day. At the end of the billing cycle, these daily charges are summed. This is why carrying a balance — even a few days after the due date — can be expensive at typical APRs of 20–29%.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I only make minimum payments?",
    a: "Minimum payments are typically 1–3% of your balance. At a 22% APR, a $3,000 balance with $60 minimum payments takes over 8 years to clear and costs more than $2,500 in interest alone — nearly doubling the original debt. This calculator shows exactly how much time and money different payment amounts save.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good monthly payment to make?",
    a: "A good rule of thumb is to pay at least 3× the minimum payment, or set a target payoff date and work backwards. Doubling your minimum payment can cut repayment time by 50–70% and save thousands in interest. Use the calculator above to find the payment that makes sense for your budget.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does APR mean on a credit card?",
    a: "APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate — the yearly interest rate charged on any unpaid balance. Most credit cards charge 19–29% APR in 2026. You pay no interest if you pay your full statement balance each month before the due date. Interest only applies when you carry a balance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the payment cover the interest warning mean?",
    a: "If your monthly payment is less than the monthly interest charge (APR ÷ 12 × balance), your balance will actually grow every month even though you're making payments. At 22% APR on a $3,000 balance, the minimum interest charge is $55/month — any payment below that means the debt grows indefinitely.",

    icon: "📈",
    title: "Daily compounding makes APR brutal",
    body: "At 22% APR, you're paying 0.060% per day on your balance. That sounds tiny — but on a $5,000 balance it's $3/day, $90/month, $1,100/year in pure interest before you've paid down a single dollar of the original debt. The only way to stop it is to pay faster than interest accrues.",
  },
  {
    icon: "💡",
    title: "Doubling your payment has a massive effect",
    body: "If you're paying $100/month on a $3,000 balance at 22% APR, increasing to $200/month cuts the repayment time from 46 months to 18 months — saving 28 months and over $900 in interest. Small payment increases have a disproportionately large impact because of how compound interest works in reverse.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🎯",
    title: "Target a payoff date, not a payment amount",
    body: "Instead of asking 'what can I afford?', ask 'when do I want this gone?' If you want your $4,000 balance cleared in 12 months at 22% APR, you need to pay around $375/month. Working backwards from a goal is more motivating — and this calculator makes it easy to find that number.",
