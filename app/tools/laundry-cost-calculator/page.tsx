const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does one load of laundry cost?",
    a: "The typical cost in the US is $0.80–$1.50 per load at home, depending on your electricity rate, whether you use a gas or electric dryer, water costs, and detergent. At-home laundry is significantly cheaper than a laundromat ($3–$5 per load). This calculator shows your personal cost based on your actual inputs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much electricity does a washer and dryer use?",
    a: "A standard top-loading washer uses approximately 0.3–0.5 kWh per cycle. An electric dryer uses 3.0–4.0 kWh per cycle. Combined, expect about 3.5–4.5 kWh per complete laundry load. This calculator uses 3.8 kWh as the combined default, which is a good average for standard US appliances.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does washing in cold water save money?",
    a: "Yes, significantly. About 90% of the energy used by a washing machine goes toward heating water. Cold-water cycles use approximately 0.1–0.3 kWh instead of 0.3–0.5 kWh — a reduction of 40–60% for the wash cycle. Modern detergents are formulated to work in cold water. The dryer remains the dominant energy cost regardless.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much water does a washing machine use per load?",
    a: "A modern Energy Star-certified front-loader uses 15–20 gallons per load. Older top-loaders use 25–40 gallons. At the US average water rate of about $0.004–$0.006 per gallon, water costs are typically $0.06–$0.20 per load — significant, but less than electricity and detergent.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I reduce my laundry costs?",
    a: "The biggest savings: (1) Run only full loads — half-loads use similar electricity and water. (2) Switch to cold water washing. (3) Clean the dryer lint trap before every load for better airflow. (4) Use the sensor dry setting instead of a timer. (5) Buy larger detergent bottles — the cost per load drops dramatically with size.",

    body: "The washing machine uses roughly 0.5 kWh per load. The electric dryer uses 3.0–4.0 kWh — six to eight times more. If you want to meaningfully reduce your electricity bill, focus on the dryer: clean the lint trap, use sensor-dry, air-dry when possible, or switch to a heat-pump dryer.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🧴",
    title: "Detergent cost varies wildly by brand and size",
    body: "Store-brand detergent can cost as little as $0.08 per load. Premium pods can cost $0.50–$0.75 per load. The difference over 400 loads per year is $168–$268. Buying larger formats almost always lowers the cost per load — check the unit price, not the shelf price.",

    icon: "💧",
    title: "Full loads are the easiest optimization",
    body: "Running a half-load uses roughly the same electricity and water as a full load. Consolidating 8 half-loads into 4 full loads effectively halves your laundry costs with zero sacrifice in cleanliness. Most Energy Star washers have a load-sensing feature — use it.",

At $1.50/load and 8 loads/week (a family of four), it's over $600/year. That's before adding laundromat visits, dry cleaning, or hand-washing specialized items.",
          "The biggest lever is the electricity rate — if you're in a high-rate state like California or Hawaii ($0.25–0.35/kWh), your cost per load can reach $1.50–$1.80 in electricity alone. In a low-rate state like Louisiana ($0.10/kWh), it's under $0.50. Cold-water washing is the single most impactful change most households can make.",
