const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much screen time is too much for adults?",
    a: "There's no universal limit, but research consistently links more than 6–7 hours of recreational screen time per day with increased anxiety, poor sleep, and reduced productivity. The average US adult spends about 7 hours per day on screens — most of it not for work.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does this calculator measure opportunity cost?",
    a: "Opportunity cost = hours of screen time × your hourly rate × days per year. If you value your time at $35/hour and spend 4 hours/day on non-work screens, that's $51,100/year in time equivalent. This isn't money you 'lose' — it's the value of what you could do instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts as screen time in this calculator?",
    a: "Only non-work screen time: social media, streaming, gaming, browsing, messaging. Work-related screen use (video calls, spreadsheets, coding) doesn't count — the point is to measure recreational or passive consumption where you're not generating output.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the average daily screen time in the US?",
    a: "Americans average about 7 hours of daily screen time across all devices. Of that, 3–5 hours is non-work recreational use. Smartphone-specific usage averages 4.5–5 hours/day, with the majority going to social media, YouTube, and messaging apps.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does reducing screen time actually improve productivity?",
    a: "Studies consistently show yes. A 2018 Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology study found that limiting social media to 30 minutes/day significantly reduced loneliness and depression within 3 weeks. Even small reductions (1–2 hours/day) free up substantial time for skills, health, or income-generating activities.",

    title: "What you could build with that time",

  {
    icon: "😴",
    title: "Screen time destroys sleep quality",
    body: "Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin for up to 3 hours after use. People who use devices for 2+ hours before bed take 30% longer to fall asleep and report significantly lower sleep quality. Poor sleep reduces productivity by 20–30% the next day — amplifying the total daily cost of late-night scrolling.",
