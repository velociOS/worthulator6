const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I know what salary to ask for?",
    a: "Research the market range for your role using sources like Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Your ask should sit at or above the midpoint if your experience and skills justify it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it always worth negotiating a salary?",
    a: "Yes. Studies show that fewer than half of candidates negotiate their first offer, yet those who do earn $5,000–$10,000 more on average. Over a 20-year career, a single negotiation can compound into hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the leverage score mean?",
    a: "The leverage score is a composite of your years of experience, how well your skills match the role, and how urgently the company needs to fill the position. A higher score means you have more negotiating power.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I name a number first?",
    a: "Ideally, you want the employer to anchor first. If pressed, give a range where the bottom of your range is your desired number, so the employer focuses on the lower figure while you still have room to manoeuvre.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if they say the offer is non-negotiable?",
    a: "Everything is negotiable. If base salary is fixed, negotiate signing bonuses, extra PTO, remote-work flexibility, or an earlier performance review date. These have real monetary value.",
  },
