const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you convert salary to hourly?",
    a: "Divide your annual salary by the total hours you work per year. For a standard 40hr/week, 52-week year: $65,000 ÷ 2,080 = $31.25/hour. Adjust hours per week and weeks worked if your situation differs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the formula for salary to hourly?",
    a: "Hourly Rate = Annual Salary ÷ (Hours Per Week × Weeks Per Year). Using 40 hours and 52 weeks gives 2,080 total hours annually. Many use 2,000 (50 weeks, accounting for 2 weeks vacation).",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use 52 or 50 weeks?",
    a: "Use 52 if you work all year with no unpaid time off. Use 50 if you take roughly 2 weeks of unpaid vacation. For comparing job offers, use the same number for both. The difference on a $70k salary is about $0.67/hour.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is my effective hourly rate less than I thought?",
    a: "Salaried employees often work more than 40 hours without extra pay. If you regularly work 50 hours, your effective rate on a $65k salary drops from $31.25 to $25/hour. This calculator uses your stated hours — be honest with it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I compare a salary offer with a freelance rate?",
    a: "Convert the salary to hourly using this calculator, then compare against the freelance rate. Remember: the freelance rate needs to cover your own taxes (25–30% more), health insurance, retirement contributions, and unpaid time — so the break-even freelance rate is typically 1.5–2× the equivalent salary rate.",

    body: "Salaried roles often include benefits (health insurance, 401k, PTO) worth $15,000–25,000/year in value. A $70k salary with full benefits may be worth more than an $85k contract role without them. Always compare the total package.",
