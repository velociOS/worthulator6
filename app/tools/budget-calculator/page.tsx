const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a healthy savings rate?",
    a: "Financial experts generally recommend saving at least 20% of take-home pay (the 50/30/20 rule). However, any positive savings rate is better than zero. If you're paying off high-interest debt, directing extra money there can be more valuable than a traditional savings rate. A savings rate above 30% puts you on track for early financial independence.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 50/30/20 budget rule?",
    a: "The 50/30/20 rule allocates 50% of take-home pay to needs (housing, food, transport, utilities), 30% to wants (dining out, entertainment, subscriptions), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. It's a simple starting framework — most people need to adjust the percentages based on their cost of living and goals.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I reduce my expense ratio?",
    a: "Focus on your largest fixed expenses first — housing and transport often make up 40–60% of budgets. Downsizing, refinancing, or moving can have a bigger impact than cutting small discretionary spends. Then audit subscriptions (the average American has 12+ active subscriptions), food costs (meal prepping vs. takeaways), and debt interest rates (refinancing or balance transfers).",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include irregular expenses in my monthly budget?",
    a: "Yes — irregular expenses like car insurance, annual subscriptions, and holiday spending should be divided by 12 and included as a monthly 'sinking fund' line item. Most budget shortfalls happen not from overspending on daily items, but from irregular costs that weren't planned for. Budget for them monthly so the money is ready.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if my budget shows overspending?",
    a: "Start with the biggest lever: housing. If rent or mortgage is above 35% of take-home, you're likely in a structural deficit that small cuts elsewhere can't fix. Next, look at debt payments — high minimums reduce flexibility significantly. Then tackle subscriptions and food costs as the most controllable variables in most budgets.",

    title: "Debt payments kill savings rate",
    body: "High minimum debt payments are the silent killer of savings rates. A $500/month debt payment on a 22% APR credit card costs $6,000/year with minimal progress on the principal. Prioritising high-interest debt payoff over investing (when rate > 7%) is mathematically sound — use the avalanche or snowball method.",
