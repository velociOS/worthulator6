const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much should I contribute to my 401k?", a: "At minimum, contribute enough to capture your full employer match — that's a 50–100% instant return. The general rule of thumb is 15% of gross income including any match." },
  { q: "What is the 2025 401k contribution limit?", a: "The IRS limit for 2025 is $23,500 for employee contributions ($31,000 if you're 50+). Total contributions including employer match can't exceed $70,000." },
  { q: "What return should I assume?", a: "A 7% annual return is commonly used — it reflects the S&P 500's historical average after adjusting for inflation. More aggressive portfolios may average 8–10%; conservative ones 4–5%." },
  { q: "What happens if I withdraw early?", a: "Early withdrawals before age 59½ incur a 10% penalty plus ordinary income taxes. A $50,000 withdrawal could cost you $20,000+ in taxes and penalties depending on your bracket." },
  { q: "Should I choose traditional or Roth 401k?", a: "Traditional reduces taxable income now; you pay taxes on withdrawals. Roth uses after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, Roth usually wins." },
