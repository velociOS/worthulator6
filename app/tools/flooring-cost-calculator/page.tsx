const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does flooring cost per square foot?",
    a: "Material costs vary widely by type: laminate ($1–5/sq ft), vinyl/LVP ($2–7/sq ft), engineered hardwood ($4–12/sq ft), solid hardwood ($5–15/sq ft), ceramic tile ($1–20/sq ft depending on grade), porcelain tile ($3–35/sq ft), carpet ($2–8/sq ft for materials). Labour typically adds 50–100% of material cost for installation (40% used in this calculator as a baseline). Total installed cost for mid-range flooring: $5–15/sq ft all-in is common.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in flooring installation labour costs?",
    a: "Labour covers: removal of existing flooring (if applicable), subfloor prep and levelling, underlayment installation, flooring installation, transitions and trim, and cleanup. Labour rate is affected by flooring type (hardwood costs more to install than laminate), subfloor condition (levelling and repairs add cost), layout complexity (diagonal or herringbone patterns require more time), and regional labour market rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include a waste factor in my flooring estimate?",
    a: "Yes — always add 10% for waste to your measured area before calculating cost. This calculator uses your room dimensions directly; to be safe, increase your length or width by 5–10% to account for waste in cutting, spoilage, and off-cuts. Diagonal installations require a 15–20% waste factor. Herringbone requires 20–25%.",
  },
  {
    q: "What flooring type is best value for money?",
    a: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) has become the most popular choice for value: durable, 100% waterproof, DIY-friendly installation, realistic wood/stone visuals, and $3–8/sq ft installed. It's displaced laminate in most applications. Engineered hardwood offers genuine wood aesthetics for $8–15/sq ft installed. Solid hardwood is the premium option ($12–25/sq ft installed) with the ability to sand and refinish multiple times.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I install flooring myself to save money?",
    a: "Laminate and LVP click-lock systems are very DIY-friendly — no glue, no nails, floating installation. A handy homeowner can install 50–100 sq ft per day with basic tools (pull bar, tapping block, saw, spacers). Saving labour on a 200 sq ft room at $3/sq ft = $600 saved. Tile installation is harder — requires cutting tools, precise levelling, adhesive work, and grouting. Hardwood flooring is complex and best left to professionals.",

    title: "LVP has changed flooring economics",
    body: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is now the dominant flooring choice for kitchens, bathrooms, and open-plan living areas. It's 100% waterproof (unlike laminate, which swells), extremely durable (15–25 year warranties from leading brands), click-lock DIY-friendly, and realistically mimics hardwood or stone at a fraction of the cost. If you're replacing flooring throughout a home, LVP offers the best combination of value, durability, and ease of installation.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📊",
    title: "Where flooring costs escalate",
    body: "The biggest cost surprises come from: subfloor remediation (fixing squeaks, levelling, moisture barriers can add $1–3/sq ft), removing existing flooring ($1–2/sq ft for glue-down hardwood or tile), stair nosing and transitions ($20–80 per opening), and waste for complex patterns. Get a detailed quote that specifies what's included — 'supply and install' can mean very different things between contractors.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⏰",
    title: "Sequence your renovation correctly",
    body: "Flooring should be installed after painting but before baseboards and trim (or at minimum, new trim installed after flooring). Install flooring before kitchen cabinets go in if possible — it simplifies cuts and ensures the floor runs under appliances. Acclimate wood flooring (including engineered) in the room for 48–72 hours before installation to reduce post-install expansion and contraction.",
