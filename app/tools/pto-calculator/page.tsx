const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do employers have to pay out unused PTO?",
    a: "It depends on the state. California, Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska require PTO payout on termination. Most other states allow employers to set their own policy. Check your employee handbook — many companies pay out accrued PTO regardless of legal requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you calculate the cash value of PTO?",
    a: "Multiply your hourly rate by the number of PTO hours remaining. If you earn $35/hour and have 80 hours of PTO, it's worth $2,800. If you're salaried, divide your annual salary by 2,080 to get your hourly rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between PTO and vacation days?",
    a: "PTO (Paid Time Off) is a combined bank of hours used for any purpose — vacation, sick days, personal days. Traditional vacation is specifically for leisure travel. Most modern employers now offer PTO instead of separate vacation and sick leave.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use my PTO before leaving a job?",
    a: "If your state doesn't require payout, yes — take it before you leave. Even if payout is required, using the time is usually better because you get the benefit of the rest plus the pay. Give proper notice but use any remaining PTO during your notice period where possible.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to unused PTO at the end of the year?",
    a: "'Use it or lose it' policies are common in states that allow them. California prohibits use-it-or-lose-it for vacation. If your employer has rollover limits, track your balance carefully — unused PTO past the cap often vanishes on January 1.",
  },
