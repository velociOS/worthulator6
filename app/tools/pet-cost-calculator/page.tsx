const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to own a dog per year?",
    a: "The American Pet Products Association estimates $1,500–$4,000+ per year for a dog, depending on size, health needs, and lifestyle. Large breeds, specialist diets, and regular grooming push costs to the higher end.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to own a cat per year?",
    a: "Cats typically cost $600–$1,800 per year for routine care. Key costs include food ($200–$600), vet check-ups ($200–$400), litter ($150–$300), and insurance if you carry it. Emergency vet visits can add thousands.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is pet insurance worth it?",
    a: "For most people, yes — especially for dogs and cats under 7 years old. A single emergency surgery can cost $3,000–$8,000. Insurance typically runs $300–$700/year and can save significant money in a single claim.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in 'other costs'?",
    a: "Other costs include grooming, boarding or dog-sitting when you travel, toys and bedding, training classes, flea and tick prevention, and any specialist food supplements or medications not covered by insurance.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do pets live?",
    a: "The average dog lives 10–13 years (varies greatly by breed), while domestic cats live 12–18 years. The lifetime cost figure helps you understand the full financial commitment before adopting.",
