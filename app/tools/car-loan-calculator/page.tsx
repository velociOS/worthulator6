const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How is a car loan payment calculated?",
    a: "Monthly Payment = Loan Amount × [r × (1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n − 1], where r is the monthly interest rate (APR ÷ 12) and n is the number of months. The loan amount is the vehicle price minus your down payment and any trade-in credit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose a 60-month or 72-month loan?",
    a: "A longer term lowers your monthly payment but significantly increases total interest paid. A 60-month vs 72-month loan on $25,000 at 7% APR: the 60-month costs $4,561 in interest; the 72-month costs $5,491 — $930 more for the same car. Choose the shortest term you can comfortably afford.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good APR for a car loan in 2026?",
    a: "For borrowers with excellent credit (750+), new car loan APRs in 2026 typically range from 5–7%. For good credit (700–749), expect 7–9%. For fair credit (650–699), 9–14%. Used car loans generally carry rates 1–3% higher than new car loans for the same credit profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does a trade-in affect my loan?",
    a: "Your trade-in value is applied directly to the purchase price, reducing the loan amount. A $5,000 trade-in on a $30,000 vehicle reduces your loan to $25,000 (minus down payment). This reduces both your monthly payment and total interest paid.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much car can I actually afford?",
    a: "A common rule of thumb: your total monthly car payment should not exceed 10–15% of your monthly take-home pay. A separate rule: the total cost of owning a car (payment + insurance + fuel + maintenance) should stay under 20% of take-home pay. Use the calculator to check if a vehicle fits within those guardrails.",

  },
  {
    icon: "💰",
    title: "Down payment cuts both payment and interest",
    body: "A larger down payment reduces the principal — which reduces both the monthly payment and total interest over the life of the loan. It also improves your loan-to-value ratio, which can qualify you for a lower APR. Aim for at least 10–20% down on a new vehicle.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔄",
    title: "Your trade-in is a silent down payment",
    body: "Many buyers focus on the new car's price and forget that their trade-in is effectively cash. A $6,000 trade-in reduces your loan principal by $6,000 — the equivalent of a $6,000 down payment. Negotiate the trade-in value and purchase price separately to maximise both.",
