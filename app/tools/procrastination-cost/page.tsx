const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much does procrastination cost businesses?", a: "Studies estimate procrastination costs the US economy $650 billion annually in lost productivity. Individually, a 2-hour daily procrastination habit costs a $40/hr worker about $20,000/year." },
  { q: "Is procrastination always bad?", a: "Not always. Deliberate delay (waiting for more information before deciding) is rational. 'Active procrastination' — intentionally delaying to work better under pressure — works for some people. Chronic avoidance of important tasks is the problem." },
  { q: "What's the root cause of procrastination?", a: "Research points to emotional regulation, not laziness. People avoid tasks tied to negative feelings (anxiety, self-doubt, boredom). It's a coping mechanism that trades short-term relief for long-term cost." },
  { q: "What's the most effective way to stop procrastinating?", a: "The 2-minute rule (if it takes under 2 minutes, do it now), time-blocking specific tasks, removing environmental distractions, and starting with the smallest possible step ('just open the file') are well-evidenced strategies." },
  { q: "How do I calculate my real hourly value?", a: "Divide your annual salary by 2,000 (40 hrs × 50 weeks). $60,000/year ≈ $30/hr. For self-employed people, use your billable rate. For life decisions, consider what your free time is worth to you personally." },

  { icon: "🧠", title: "Deep work is worth more", body: "Research by Cal Newport and others suggests focused, uninterrupted work is 2–4× more productive than fragmented attention. An hour of deep work often produces more than 3 hours of distracted work." },
  { icon: "💙", title: "The self-compassion paradox", body: "Paradoxically, being harsh on yourself about procrastinating tends to make it worse. Self-forgiveness about past procrastination — combined with a specific plan — is more effective for long-term change." },
