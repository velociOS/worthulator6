const FAQS = [
  { q: "What's the difference between marginal and effective tax rate?", a: "Your marginal rate is the rate on your last dollar earned — the 'bracket' you're in. Your effective rate is your total tax ÷ total income. Most people pay far less than their marginal rate." },
  { q: "What are the 2025 federal tax brackets?", a: "Single filers: 10% up to $11,925; 12% up to $48,475; 22% up to $103,350; 24% up to $197,300; 32% up to $250,525; 35% up to $626,350; 37% above that." },
  { q: "Does being in a higher bracket mean I pay more on ALL income?", a: "No. This is one of the most common tax myths. The US uses a progressive system — only the income above each threshold gets taxed at the higher rate. Moving brackets doesn't cost you money." },
  { q: "What is the standard deduction?", a: "For 2025: $15,000 for single filers, $30,000 for married filing jointly. This comes off your income before brackets are applied, lowering your taxable income." },
  { q: "Should I do a W-4 adjustment?", a: "If you consistently owe a large amount or get a very large refund, you may be under- or over-withholding. A large refund means you gave the government an interest-free loan all year." },
