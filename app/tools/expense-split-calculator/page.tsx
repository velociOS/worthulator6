const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you split expenses equally in a group?",
    a: "Equal splitting is simple: total bill ÷ number of people = each person's share. For a $200 dinner between 5 people, each person pays $40. If a tip is included, calculate the tipped total first: $200 × 1.20 (20% tip) = $240 ÷ 5 = $48 each. This calculator handles both steps automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should the tip be calculated before or after splitting?",
    a: "The standard approach is to calculate the tip on the pre-tip total, then split the tipped amount equally. This calculator adds the tip to the total first and then divides by people, which is the most common and fairest approach when everyone ordered similarly. If people ordered very differently, itemised splitting (splitting each person's order individually) is fairer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the fairest way to split shared expenses when people earn different amounts?",
    a: "Options for unequal splitting: proportional to income (each person pays an equal percentage of their income), by usage (whoever used something more pays more), flat equal split (simplest, most commonly used), or itemised (each person pays only what they personally ordered or used). Most friend groups default to equal splitting for simplicity unless there's a significant income disparity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are good apps for tracking shared expenses?",
    a: "Splitwise is the most popular app for tracking ongoing shared expenses in groups — it supports complex scenarios like some people paying some bills and reconciles everything to minimal payment transfers. Tricount is a free alternative. For one-off events, this calculator is faster than opening an app. Google Sheets shared documents work well for flatmates with monthly recurring shared costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle it when someone can't pay their share?",
    a: "In close groups, the common approach is to cover the shortfall and let the person pay back later — track it via Splitwise or a note. For recurring flat situations, a shared house account (all flatmates pay in monthly) avoids the need for constant person-to-person tracking. For large groups or events, collecting money in advance (via payment links) before the event eliminates the awkward chasing afterwards.",

    icon: "✈️",
    title: "Group travel and shared costs",
    body: "Group trips generate complex shared costs: Airbnb, hired car, fuel, groceries, tours, meals. The simplest approach is one person pays each expense, tracks the total, and at the end uses this calculator to determine each person's equal share. More complex trips benefit from Splitwise's 'paid by' tracking that handles multiple payers automatically.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🏠",
    title: "Flatmates and shared living",
    body: "For recurring shared costs (broadband, council tax, shared subscriptions, household supplies), the cleanest system is a shared house account each flatmate pays into equally each month. For one-off shared purchases, this calculator quickly confirms the split amount. For fair utility splitting when usage differs, consider bill-by-usage methods rather than pure equal division.",
