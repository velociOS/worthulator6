// ─── FAQ data ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is it better to rent or buy a home?",
    a: "There is no universal answer — it depends on how long you plan to stay, local home appreciation rates, your investment return assumptions, and the true all-in cost of ownership. In general, buying tends to outperform renting financially after 5–8 years in most US markets, but renting and investing the difference can win over shorter time horizons or in high-appreciation markets where rent is far cheaper than ownership costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the break-even point for buying vs renting?",
    a: "The break-even point is the year when the buyer's net worth (home equity minus selling costs) first exceeds the renter's net worth (invested down payment plus monthly savings). Nationally, this is typically 5–8 years, but it varies by city, mortgage rate, and how much is invested if renting. This calculator shows you the exact break-even year for your specific numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does renting mean throwing money away?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Every renter's payment covers a real service — housing — just as mortgage interest, property tax, insurance, and maintenance do for homeowners. What matters is the total financial outcome. Renters who invest the down payment and monthly savings difference can build significant wealth, particularly when investment returns exceed home appreciation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to sell a house?",
    a: "Selling costs in the US typically run 5–8% of the sale price. This includes real estate agent commissions (traditionally 5–6%), transfer taxes, title fees, and staging costs. On a $400,000 home, that is $20,000–$32,000 in transaction costs — a significant drag that makes short-term buying risky. This calculator includes selling costs in the break-even analysis.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the hidden costs of owning a home?",
    a: "Beyond your mortgage payment, homeownership includes property taxes (typically 0.5–2.5% of value per year), homeowner's insurance (0.25–1%), maintenance and repairs (plan for 1–2% of home value annually), HOA fees where applicable, and PMI if your down payment is under 20%. Together, these can add $500–$2,000+ per month on a median-priced home.",
  },
  {
    q: "What investment return should I use in the rent vs buy calculator?",
    a: "The S&P 500 has returned roughly 10% annually before inflation and 7% after inflation over the long run. A common conservative assumption is 5–7% for a diversified index fund portfolio. Choosing a higher investment return generally favours renting (because the invested down payment grows faster), while choosing lower returns favours buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does home appreciation affect the rent vs buy decision?",
    a: "Home appreciation is the growth in your property's value over time. The US national average is roughly 3–4% per year nominally (around 0–1% after inflation). In high-demand cities like San Francisco or New York, appreciation can be much higher — which dramatically favours buying. In stagnant markets, it may be lower. Try adjusting the appreciation slider to see how it changes your outcome.",

              Rent vs Buy: What the Calculator Actually Models
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              <p>
                Most rent vs buy tools only compare monthly payments. That is misleading. A $2,000
                mortgage payment and a $2,000 rent payment are not equivalent — the mortgage comes
                with property taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA fees, and tens of thousands in
                closing and selling costs. And the renter has an asset the buyer does not: the down
                payment, sitting in an investment account compounding over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                This calculator models both paths honestly. The buying path accumulates home equity
                as the loan is paid down and the home appreciates — but subtracts every cost of
                ownership and the eventual selling costs when you leave. The renting path invests the
                down payment and any monthly savings (when rent is cheaper than the all-in buying
                cost) and compounds that at your expected investment return. The result is a true
                net worth comparison — not a marketing pitch for either side.

              The Hidden Costs of Homeownership

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              First-time buyers are often shocked by the gap between their mortgage payment and
              their actual cost of ownership. On a $400,000 home, the additional costs can include:

              What Is the Break-Even Point?
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              <p>
                The break-even point is the year when buying&apos;s net worth (home equity minus selling
                costs) first surpasses renting&apos;s net worth (invested savings). Before that point,
                renting and investing the difference is the wealthier path. After it, buying pulls
                ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                In most US cities at current mortgage rates (around 7%), the break-even point falls
                between 5 and 9 years. In high-cost markets where rent is relatively cheap compared
                to purchase price, it can stretch to 10–15 years. In markets where rent is high and
                appreciation is strong, it may be as short as 3–4 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important thing: if you are not confident you will stay in a home past the
                break-even point, the data strongly suggests renting is the wealthier choice. Moving
                before break-even means absorbing all the upfront costs with none of the long-term
                appreciation gain.

              The Opportunity Cost of the Down Payment
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              <p>
                A 20% down payment on a $400,000 home is $80,000. That is $80,000 that could instead
                be invested. At a 7% annual return (S&amp;P 500 long-run average after inflation), that
                lump sum grows to approximately $157,000 in 10 years and $305,000 in 20 years —
                without adding a single extra dollar.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what &quot;opportunity cost&quot; means in the rent vs buy debate. The down payment
                is not lost when you rent — it is deployed differently. Whether that investment
                outperforms home equity depends on market returns vs home appreciation, and this
                calculator lets you model both honestly.

              Common Mistakes in the Rent vs Buy Calculation
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              <p>
                The most common mistake is comparing monthly rent to mortgage payment and calling it
                done. The mortgage payment covers principal and interest only — it ignores property
                tax, insurance, maintenance, HOA, PMI, and the cost of the capital tied up in the
                down payment. A fairer comparison uses the total monthly cost of ownership against
                the monthly rent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second most common mistake is forgetting selling costs. Many buyers mentally
                book equity as profit without subtracting the 5–7% it costs to sell. On a $500,000
                home, that is $25,000–$35,000 that never reaches your pocket.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, people often assume renters &quot;throw away&quot; money while owners &quot;build wealth.&quot;
                The reality is more nuanced: a renter who consistently invests the down payment and
                monthly savings difference often ends up in a comparable or better financial position
                — it depends on discipline, market conditions, and time horizon.

              This calculator models a standard 30-year (or custom term) amortising mortgage using
              the annuity formula. Home value, property tax, insurance, and maintenance grow with
              the home appreciation rate annually. Rent increases are applied once per year. The
              renter&apos;s portfolio is modelled as a lump-sum investment of the down payment plus
              closing costs on day one, plus monthly contributions equal to any excess of the
              all-in buying cost over rent, compounded at the investment return rate. The buyer&apos;s
              net worth is home equity minus projected selling costs at exit. Neither path accounts
              for income tax deductions (mortgage interest deductibility) or capital gains tax on
              investment or home sale — results are pre-tax estimates. Inflation is not applied to
              normalise values; all figures are nominal.
