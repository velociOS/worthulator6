const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Why is my effective hourly rate lower than what I charge?",
    a: "As a freelancer or gig worker, you pay both the employee and employer share of self-employment taxes (around 15.3% on net earnings), plus business expenses like software, equipment, and marketing. These reduce what you actually take home per hour worked.",
  },
  {
    q: "What expenses should I include?",
    a: "Common side hustle expenses include platform fees (Etsy, Fiverr, Upwork), software subscriptions, marketing costs, equipment depreciation, home office costs, and professional insurance. A good rule of thumb is 10–20% of revenue for digital services, higher for product businesses.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is 4.33 used in the calculation?",
    a: "4.33 is the average number of weeks in a month (52 weeks ÷ 12 months). Multiplying your weekly hours by 4.33 gives an accurate monthly estimate rather than using a fixed 4 weeks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a side hustle worth it at minimum wage?",
    a: "Not necessarily by income alone — but many side hustles provide skill development, portfolio work, or long-term business potential. Use the calculator to set a minimum rate you're willing to work below, and re-evaluate quarterly.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I set aside for taxes?",
    a: "As a self-employed person, set aside 25–30% of net earnings for taxes. This covers federal income tax and self-employment tax. Use quarterly estimated payments to avoid underpayment penalties.",
  },
