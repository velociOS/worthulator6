                How is take home pay calculated in the UK?
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                Your take home pay — also called your net salary — is what remains from your gross
                salary after your employer has deducted PAYE income tax and National Insurance
                contributions (NICs). Both deductions are applied automatically through the HMRC
                payroll system before your salary reaches your bank account.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                The calculation works in three steps. First, your personal allowance (£12,570 for
                2025/26) is subtracted from your gross salary to produce your{" "}
                <strong className="text-gray-800">taxable income</strong>. Second, PAYE income tax
                is applied to that taxable income using the banded rates below. Third, Class 1
                National Insurance is calculated separately — it applies to earnings above £12,570
                regardless of any other allowances.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                For most standard employees, these two deductions account for virtually all the
                difference between gross and net pay. Other items — such as pension contributions,
                student loan repayments, or salary sacrifice arrangements — can reduce your
                take-home further but are not included in this calculator.

              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                <strong className="text-gray-800">Gross pay</strong> is your salary before any
                deductions — the figure your employer agrees to pay you and the number on your
                offer letter. <strong className="text-gray-800">Net pay</strong> (also called
                take-home pay) is what actually lands in your bank account after income tax,
                National Insurance, and any other deductions have been taken off.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                The gap between the two can be substantial. For a £35,000 salary, the difference
                is roughly £7,500 per year — about 21% of gross pay. For a £70,000 earner, the
                gap grows to over £21,000 per year as the higher rate tax band kicks in.

              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
                This distinction matters for budgeting. When comparing job offers, negotiating a
                pay rise, or planning monthly outgoings, always work from your net figure — not
                the headline gross salary. Two people on the same gross salary can have different
                net pay depending on their tax code, pension arrangements, or student loan plan.
