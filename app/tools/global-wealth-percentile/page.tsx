  { q: "What counts as 'wealthy' globally?", a: "According to Credit Suisse, the top 1% globally requires a net worth of ~$1 million USD. The top 10% threshold is approximately $100,000 USD. Over half the world's adults have net worth under $10,000." },
  { q: "How is global wealth distributed?", a: "The richest 1% own about 46% of global wealth. The bottom 50% own just 1.2%. The distribution is far more unequal globally than within any single developed country." },
  { q: "How does income compare to wealth?", a: "Income and wealth are related but different. High earners who spend everything have low net worth. People with old money may have high wealth but modest income. Both percentiles matter in different contexts." },
  { q: "Does cost of living affect the ranking?", a: "This calculator uses nominal USD comparisons. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments would change the rankings — $50,000 goes much further in India than the US. Nominal rankings reflect global market power." },
  { q: "Why might this be motivating?", a: "Most people in developed countries rank in the global top 10–20% without realising it. Understanding your relative position globally can shift perspective on gratitude, giving, and financial goals." },
