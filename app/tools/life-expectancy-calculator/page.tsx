  { q: "What is the average US life expectancy?", a: "As of 2024, US life expectancy is approximately 78.4 years. Women average 81.1 years; men average 75.8 years. It varies significantly by state, race, and socioeconomic status." },
  { q: "How much does smoking reduce life expectancy?", a: "On average, smoking reduces life expectancy by 10 years compared to non-smokers. Quitting before 40 recovers about 9 of those years. Quitting before 35 recovers almost all of it." },
  { q: "How much does exercise extend life expectancy?", a: "150 minutes of moderate exercise per week is associated with adding 3–7 years of life expectancy. Even 15 minutes/day of walking adds ~3 years compared to complete inactivity." },
  { q: "What is the biggest predictor of longevity?", a: "Social connection is consistently the strongest predictor. After that: not smoking, maintaining healthy weight, regular exercise, limited alcohol, and sleep quality. Genetics account for roughly 25–30% of lifespan variation." },
  { q: "Should I be worried about this estimate?", a: "This is a rough estimate for reflection, not a medical prediction. Life expectancy is a population average — individuals vary enormously. Use it as a framework for planning and prioritisation, not as a prognosis." },

  { icon: "💪", title: "The compression of morbidity", body: "The goal isn't just to live longer — it's to compress the period of decline into a short window at the end. Regular exercise, healthy diet, and non-smoking are the most evidence-based approaches to healthspan, not just lifespan." },
