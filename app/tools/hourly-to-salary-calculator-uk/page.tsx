              How does the hourly to salary calculation work?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              The conversion is simple: multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you work each week, then multiply by the number of weeks you work in a year.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              For example, if you earn £15 per hour on a standard UK 37.5-hour contract, your annual salary works out to £15 × 37.5 × 52 — which is £29,250. If you earn £20 an hour on a 40-hour contract, that&apos;s £41,600 per year. The difference between a 37.5 and 40-hour week may sound small, but it adds up to over £1,300 at £15/hr.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              One thing to watch: the UK standard is 37.5 hours per week, not 40. If you enter 40 hours when your contract specifies 37.5, you&apos;ll overestimate your annual salary by about 6.7%. Always use the hours in your employment contract.

            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              Someone earning the National Living Wage of £12.21 per hour at 37.5 hours a week brings in around £23,800 per year — a figure that sits just above the UK personal allowance threshold. A £15 hourly rate works out to £29,250, while £20 an hour at full-time hours gives roughly £39,000 annually.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              For higher-paid roles, the numbers climb quickly. At £25 per hour, a 37.5-hour week produces around £48,750 per year — just below the 40% tax threshold. Rates of £30 or £35 an hour bring annual gross income to £58,500 and £68,250 respectively, both comfortably into the higher-rate tax band. Contractors often see rates of £50–£75 per hour, which can translate to six-figure annualised earnings even on a standard full-time basis.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              These are all gross figures before tax and National Insurance. The amount you actually take home will be lower — particularly as earnings move above £50,270, where the 40% PAYE band applies.

              The annual salary shown here is gross — the amount before any deductions. In practice, most employees see three main deductions on their payslip.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              Income tax is collected via PAYE and uses a banded system. For 2025/26, earnings up to £12,570 are covered by the personal allowance and taxed at 0%. Earnings above that up to £50,270 are taxed at 20% (the basic rate), with income between £50,270 and £125,140 taxed at 40%. Only the earnings in each band are taxed at that rate — not your whole salary.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
              National Insurance adds another layer. Employees pay 8% on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270, and 2% above that. Pension contributions — whether into a workplace scheme or a personal pension — reduce your taxable income and further change your take-home.
            </p>
