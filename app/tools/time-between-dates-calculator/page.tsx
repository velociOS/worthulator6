const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate the number of days between two dates?",
    a: "Subtract the earlier date from the later date. In most date systems, this gives the difference in days. For example, from January 1 to March 31 is 89 days (in a non-leap year). To convert: divide by 7 for weeks, divide by 30.44 for months (using the average month length). This calculator converts any number of days into all three units instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many days is 3 months?",
    a: "Using an average month length of 30.44 days: 3 months ≈ 91.3 days. Calendar months vary: 3 months could be 89–92 days depending on which months are included and whether there's a leap year. For planning purposes, 91 days or 13 weeks is a reliable approximation for a quarter.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many weeks is 6 months?",
    a: "6 months ≈ 26.1 weeks using the average month length (30.44 days × 6 ÷ 7 = 26.1). In practice, 6 calendar months ranges from 181–184 days, which is 25.9–26.3 weeks. The commonly used approximation is 26 weeks for a half-year.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a calendar month and 30 days?",
    a: "A calendar month is the actual month on the calendar (28–31 days depending on the month). 30 days is a fixed unit. These rarely align precisely. February has only 28–29 days; July and August both have 31. For consistent calculations, using the average month of 30.44 days (365.25 ÷ 12) gives the most accurate results across any date range.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate a countdown in weeks and days?",
    a: "Divide the total days by 7 to get full weeks, then take the remainder for leftover days. For example: 100 days ÷ 7 = 14 weeks and 2 days. This calculator shows weeks as a decimal (14.3) which includes the partial week as a fraction. For an event countdown, round down to get full weeks remaining.",

  {
    icon: "📐",
    title: "Why average month length matters",
    body: "Using 30 days/month introduces cumulative error. Over a year, 12 × 30 = 360 days — 5 days off. Using 30.44 (the true average) keeps calculations accurate. The difference matters for contracts with 'monthly' billing cycles, subscription proration, and interest calculations that compound monthly.",
