const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate a percentage discount?",
    a: "Multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal). For example, 20% off $80 = 80 × 0.20 = $16 saved. Your final price is $80 − $16 = $64. This calculator does it instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does tax apply before or after a discount?",
    a: "In most US states and retail scenarios, sales tax is applied to the discounted price, not the original price. So a $100 item at 20% off becomes $80, and then tax (e.g. 8%) is applied to $80 — not $100.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do stacked discounts work?",
    a: "Stacked discounts apply sequentially — not combined. A 20% off sale followed by a 10% coupon means you pay 80% of the original, then 90% of that. That's 72% of the original price — not 70%.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a Buy X Get Y discount?",
    a: "Buy 3 get 1 free means you get 4 items for the price of 3 — a 25% effective discount per item. The savings depend on how many items are free relative to how many you buy.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do retailers use percentage discounts to anchor perception?",
    a: "A '50% off' label signals a deal regardless of whether the original price was inflated. Studies show consumers often overestimate savings on high-percentage discounts. Always check the final price — not just the percentage.",

    title: "Percentage vs fixed discounts",
