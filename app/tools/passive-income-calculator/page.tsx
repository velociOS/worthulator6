            How passive income from investments works
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            Passive income from investments comes from the returns generated by a portfolio
            you have built over time. Unlike a salary, it doesn&apos;t require trading your
            time for money — the capital works on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            The core mechanism is compound growth. When you invest regularly, your returns
            generate their own returns. Over decades, this compounding effect means the
            growth phase of your portfolio significantly outpaces what you actually
            contributed. A portfolio worth $500,000 at 7% generates $35,000/year — without
            you doing anything.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            The key variables are: how much you start with, how much you contribute each
            month, the annual return your investments achieve, and how long you let it grow.
            This calculator models all four simultaneously.

          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            The 4% rule — also called the Bengen Rule after financial planner William Bengen
            who published it in 1994 — states that you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio in
            year one of retirement, then adjust for inflation each year, and statistically
            avoid running out of money over a 30-year retirement horizon.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            It is derived from historical US stock and bond market data. The rule assumes a
            roughly 60/40 equity/bond split, though a higher equity allocation tends to
            support higher withdrawal rates over longer periods.
