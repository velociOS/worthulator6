const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is unit pricing?",
    a: "Unit pricing expresses a product's cost per standard unit (e.g. per ounce, per 100ml, per unit). It allows you to compare different sizes of the same product or similar products across brands on a level playing field. US stores are required to display unit prices in many states, but labelling can be inconsistent.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the bigger size always cheaper per unit?",
    a: "Usually, but not always. Retailers occasionally price smaller sizes at a lower unit cost — especially when the larger size is overstocked or when they know most buyers won't check. Sales and store-brand options can also flip the equation. Always check the unit price rather than assuming bigger = better value.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate price per ounce?",
    a: "Price per ounce = Total Price / Size in Ounces. A 16 oz jar at $3.50 costs $3.50 / 16 = $0.219/oz. A 48 oz jar at $8.00 costs $8.00 / 48 = $0.167/oz. The 48 oz jar is 23.7% cheaper per ounce.",
  },
  {
    q: "What units should I use if the product is measured in grams or ml?",
    a: "Use the same unit for both items and the comparison is still valid. If Item A is 400g and Item B is 800g, enter sizes in grams rather than ounces. The calculator compares price-per-unit — as long as both items use the same unit, the result is correct.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is the cheaper per-unit option NOT the right choice?",
    a: "When you won't use it before it expires. Buying a 64 oz jar of mayonnaise at $0.12/oz is only a deal if you'll use 64 oz before it goes bad. For perishables, the effective cost includes waste. The 'cheaper' per-unit option becomes expensive if half of it ends up in the bin.",

  {
    icon: "🏷️",
    title: "Shelf labels can be misleading",
    body: "Many grocery store shelf labels display unit prices, but the units aren't always consistent — one product might show price per 100g while the adjacent product shows price per oz. Always calculate from the actual price and weight printed on the package to get a true comparison.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔄",
    title: "Store brands vs name brands",
    body: "Store-brand products are often 20–40% cheaper per unit than name-brand equivalents. For commodities like flour, rice, tinned tomatoes, and cleaning products, the quality difference is minimal. Unit pricing makes the exact saving visible — so you decide based on data rather than habit.",
  },
  {
    icon: "♻️",
    title: "Account for waste on perishables",
    body: "For fresh produce, dairy, and items with short shelf lives, factor in how much you'll actually use. A 2-litre bottle of juice at $0.04/oz is only a good deal if you'll drink all of it before it expires. For non-perishables (rice, pasta, canned goods, cleaning products), buying in bulk almost always wins.",

Even a 15% per-unit saving on something you buy 20 times a year adds up. Over a full year of grocery shopping, systematic unit price comparison can save $300–$500 for an average household.",
