const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does the missed investment calculator work?",
    a: "It applies compound interest to any amount over a number of years. The formula is: Future Value = Amount × (1 + rate)^years. A $1,000 purchase 10 years ago at 10% annual return would be $2,594 today. The difference ($1,594) is the missed gain.",
  },
  {
    q: "What annual return should I use?",
    a: "The S&P 500 has averaged ~10% annually over 30+ years (before inflation). Use 7% for a more conservative real-return estimate (adjusted for inflation). Use 12% for aggressive growth assumptions. The calculator defaults to 10% — the most commonly cited benchmark.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this mean I should never spend money?",
    a: "No — the calculator is a perspective tool, not a guilt machine. Some spending creates real value (education, health, experiences). The goal is to make the opportunity cost visible for discretionary purchases so you can make conscious trade-offs instead of automatic ones.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is opportunity cost in investing?",
    a: "Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative you didn't choose. Every dollar spent on a depreciating purchase is a dollar not compounding in the market. Over decades, this difference becomes dramatic — a $5,000 purchase at 25 is worth roughly $87,000 at 65 (at 7% real return).",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I use this to make better financial decisions?",
    a: "Before any significant discretionary purchase, run it through this calculator with your current age and expected retirement age as the years. The result is the 'true cost' of the purchase in retirement wealth. Many people find this reframes their relationship with impulse spending immediately.",

    title: "Compound interest is ruthlessly asymmetric",
    body: "The first few years of compounding look modest. The last few years are explosive. A $1,000 investment at 10% grows by $100 in year 1, but by $1,746 in year 30 alone. This is why time in the market matters far more than timing the market — and why early spending is so much more expensive than it looks.",

    title: "The latte factor is real — but it's not lattes",
    body: "David Bach's 'latte factor' has been mocked, but the math is right for larger purchases. The $5 coffee matters little. The $1,200 holiday upgrade, the $3,000 car option, the $500/month subscriptions — these are where the real opportunity cost lives. This calculator makes those numbers concrete.",

    body: "Don't just calculate what past purchases cost you — use it before future ones. Enter the purchase amount and your years until retirement. That's the true price tag. A $10,000 car upgrade at age 30 costs $76,000 in retirement wealth at a 7% real return over 35 years.",
