const FAQS = [
  { q: "When does refinancing make sense?", a: "Generally when you can lower your rate by at least 0.75–1%, plan to stay in the home past the break-even point, and the closing costs are reasonable (2–3% of the loan)." },
  { q: "How are closing costs calculated?", a: "Refinance closing costs typically run 2–5% of the loan balance, covering appraisal, origination fees, title insurance, and recording fees. Some lenders offer 'no-closing-cost' refis that roll fees into the rate." },
  { q: "What is the break-even point?", a: "The month when your cumulative monthly savings equal your closing costs. If you move or sell before that point, refinancing costs you money net-net." },
  { q: "Does refinancing reset my loan term?", a: "Yes — unless you refinance into a shorter term. A 30-year refi restarts the clock. To avoid this, some borrowers refinance into a 15-year loan or continue making their original payment amount." },
  { q: "Will refinancing hurt my credit score?", a: "There's a small, temporary dip from the hard inquiry (5–10 points). Credit bureaus treat multiple mortgage inquiries within 45 days as a single inquiry, so shop around quickly." },

  { icon: "🚫", title: "When NOT to refinance", body: "If you're 20+ years into a 30-year mortgage, most of your remaining payments are principal. A new 30-year refi at a lower rate can actually cost more total interest." },
