  {
    q: "How is self-employment tax calculated?",
    a:
      "Self-employment (SE) tax is 15.3% on 92.35% of your net self-employment income (net income × 0.9235 × 0.153). This covers the Social Security and Medicare taxes that employees and employers split. You can deduct half of SE tax from your federal taxable income.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I set aside for taxes as a freelancer?",
    a:
      "A commonly cited rule is 25–30% of gross income. However, the exact amount depends on your income level, deductions, and state taxes. This calculator gives you a more precise federal estimate. Add your state income tax rate on top.",
  },
  {
    q: "When are quarterly estimated taxes due?",
    a:
      "2026 due dates: April 15 (Q1), June 15 (Q2), September 15 (Q3), and January 15, 2027 (Q4). Missing a quarterly payment can result in an underpayment penalty even if you pay the full amount at tax time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What business expenses can I deduct?",
    a:
      "Common deductions include: home office (direct method or simplified $5/sq ft up to 300 sq ft), business portion of phone/internet, software subscriptions, professional development, equipment, business travel, health insurance premiums, and retirement contributions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I still pay FICA taxes when self-employed?",
    a:
      "Yes — as a self-employed person, you pay both the employee and employer share of Social Security (12.4%) and Medicare (2.9%) taxes. This is the self-employment tax. The cap for Social Security applies: in 2026, it applies to the first ~$176,100 of net earnings.",
