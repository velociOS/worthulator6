          <h2>How to use this retirement calculator</h2>
          <p>
            Start by entering your current age and target retirement age. The gap between these two numbers is your
            <strong> accumulation phase</strong> — the period where compound interest does most of its work. A 30-year-old
            targeting retirement at 67 has 37 years for their money to compound, which is dramatically more powerful
            than someone starting at 45 with only 22 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, enter your current savings and monthly contribution. Even modest monthly contributions, maintained
            consistently, have an outsized long-term impact. If you&apos;re looking to understand how much of your salary
            you can realistically save each month, the{" "}
            <a href="/tools/take-home-pay-calculator" className="text-emerald-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-emerald-700">
              take-home pay calculator
            </a>{" "}
            can help you work out your actual disposable income after taxes and deductions.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding the readiness score</h2>
          <p>
            The readiness score (0–100) combines two factors: <strong>income replacement rate</strong> (how much
            of your monthly income goal is covered by portfolio withdrawals and Social Security) and{" "}
            <strong>portfolio sustainability</strong> (whether your portfolio lasts through your full life expectancy).
            A score of 85+ means you&apos;re on track; 65–84 needs attention; below 65 requires action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most powerful levers for improving your score are: starting earlier, increasing monthly contributions,
            and extending your working years slightly. Even retiring 2–3 years later has a compounding effect — you
            accumulate more <em>and</em> reduce the number of drawdown years. For a deep dive into how compound
            interest builds wealth, explore the{" "}
            <a href="/tools/compound-interest-calculator" className="text-emerald-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-emerald-700">
              compound interest calculator
            </a>
            .
          </p>

          <h2>The role of inflation in retirement planning</h2>
          <p>
            Inflation is the silent tax on retirement savings. At 2.5% annual inflation, the purchasing power of money
            halves roughly every 28 years. This calculator models two key inflation effects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Inflation-adjusted portfolio value</strong>: what your retirement balance is worth in today&apos;s
              dollars — showing you the real purchasing power, not just the nominal figure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inflation-growing withdrawals</strong>: your monthly income goal grows each year of retirement
              to maintain purchasing power. This makes portfolio sustainability harder — particularly in long retirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is why the post-retirement return rate matters. If your portfolio earns 5% but inflation is 2.5%,
            your real return is approximately 2.5% — which must cover withdrawals. For context, building{" "}
            <a href="/tools/passive-income-calculator" className="text-emerald-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-emerald-700">
              passive income streams
            </a>{" "}
            alongside your portfolio can reduce withdrawal pressure and improve sustainability.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a realistic annual return assumption?</h2>
          <p>
            The US stock market (S&P 500) has returned approximately <strong>10% annually on average</strong> since 1957,
            or around <strong>7% after inflation</strong>. However, the relevant figure for planning depends on
            your investment mix, fees, and time horizon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aggressive (equity-heavy, long horizon):</strong> 7–9% nominal</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate (balanced portfolio):</strong> 5–7% nominal</li>
            <li><strong>Conservative (near retirement):</strong> 3–5% nominal</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many financial planners use 6–7% as a base case for the accumulation phase and 4–5% for the post-retirement
            phase (when portfolios shift toward income assets). This calculator allows you to set both independently
            in the advanced options.
