const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How many work hours are in a year?",
    a: "A standard full-time schedule of 8 hours/day × 5 days/week × 52 weeks = 2,080 hours per year. Subtract 10 federal holidays (80 hours) and you get approximately 2,000 productive work hours. Accounting for average sick days (~6/year) and vacation (10+ days), most full-time employees work 1,880–1,960 effective hours per year.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate hours for a freelance invoice?",
    a: "Log your actual hours worked per project, multiply by your hourly rate, and add any expenses. For example: 14.5 hours × $85/hr = $1,232.50. Always track in 15-minute increments at minimum, and log time immediately — trying to recall hours worked days later is notoriously inaccurate. Tools like Toggl, Harvest, or even a simple spreadsheet work well.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a part-time hours range?",
    a: "There is no federal definition of part-time, but most employers consider anything under 30–35 hours/week as part-time. For ACA health insurance purposes, 30 hours/week is the threshold. Part-time employees often work 15–29 hours/week. Below 10 hours/week is typically classified as casual or on-call.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate overtime on a non-standard schedule?",
    a: "FLSA overtime is calculated on a workweek basis (Sunday–Saturday or any fixed 7-day period). If you work 10 hours on Monday and 0 on Friday, you only earn overtime if your weekly total exceeds 40 hours. The daily schedule doesn't matter federally — only the weekly total (except in California, which has daily overtime rules).",
  },
  {
    q: "How many hours should I work per day for peak productivity?",
    a: "Research on deep work and cognitive performance suggests that most knowledge workers have 4–6 hours of peak productive capacity per day, not 8. Studies by K. Anders Ericsson found elite performers rarely exceed 4 hours of deliberate, focused work daily. More hours worked ≠ more output — scheduling high-priority work during peak energy windows is more effective than extending hours.",

    body: "Use this calculator for scheduling and project planning. If a project requires 120 hours of work and you have 3 team members at 6 hours/day each, total capacity is 18 hours/day — meaning the project takes about 6.7 working days. Capacity planning prevents under- and over-delivery commitments.",

  {
    icon: "⚖️",
    title: "Track actual vs contracted hours",
    body: "Many fixed-price contracts are based on estimated hours that are rarely tracked against actuals. Running even a rough hours-worked log reveals whether you're over-servicing clients. If you consistently work 30% more hours than estimated, your effective rate is 30% lower than quoted — adjust your pricing accordingly.",
