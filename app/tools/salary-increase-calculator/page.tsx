const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much of my raise will I actually take home?",
    a: "Your take-home raise depends on your marginal tax rate — the rate applied to the top slice of your income. If you're in a 22% tax bracket, a $5,000 raise results in approximately $3,900 extra per year, or about $325/month. This calculator shows exactly that figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the real value of a raise after inflation?",
    a: "If you get a 3% raise but inflation is 3%, your purchasing power hasn't increased at all — you're on a treadmill. A 5% raise with 3% inflation gives you roughly a 1.9% real raise in terms of what you can actually buy. This calculator shows the inflation-adjusted raise so you know the true value.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do small raises have a massive lifetime earnings impact?",
    a: "Because of compounding. Future raises are calculated on top of your current salary. A $5,000 raise today, compounded at 3% per year for 30 years, adds nearly $240,000 to your lifetime earnings. Every negotiation you avoid is compounded money left on the table.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I negotiate a salary increase?",
    a: "Most experts recommend reviewing salary at least annually, and negotiating every 1–2 years or with each role change. Studies show workers who negotiate earn significantly more over their careers than those who never ask. The first raise is the most important — every future one is built on top of it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a flat raise or a percentage raise better?",
    a: "It depends on your salary level. For lower salaries, a flat raise (e.g. $5,000) can represent a larger percentage. For higher salaries, a percentage raise scales better since it compounds proportionally with your base. Use the toggle in this calculator to compare both scenarios.",
