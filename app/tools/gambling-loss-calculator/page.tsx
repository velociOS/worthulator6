const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does gambling really cost long-term?",
    a: "The house always wins in the long run. Most casino games have a house edge of 1–15%: slots (2–15%), roulette (2.7–5.3%), blackjack (0.5–2%), sports betting (5–10% vig). Over time, every dollar bet returns less than a dollar on average. $50/week at a 5% effective loss rate = $130 annually in pure losses — plus the opportunity cost of not investing that money.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the opportunity cost of gambling?",
    a: "Opportunity cost is what your gambling money would be worth if invested instead. $50/week invested at 7% annually for 10 years grows to approximately $37,600. If you instead lost that $50/week gambling (total loss: $26,000), the true cost isn't just $26,000 — it's the $37,600 you could have had, making the real cost $63,600 in lost wealth.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is gambling addiction a financial or mental health problem?",
    a: "Both. Problem gambling is classified as a behavioral addiction by the DSM-5 and activates the same brain reward circuits as substance addiction. The financial damage — lost savings, debt, bankruptcy — is the most visible consequence, but relationship breakdown, depression, and anxiety are equally prevalent. If gambling is causing financial stress, seeking help from the National Council on Problem Gambling (1-800-522-4700) or Gamblers Anonymous is recommended.",
  },
  {
    q: "What percentage of gamblers lose money over time?",
    a: "Over the long term, approximately 89–95% of casino gamblers lose money. The profitability of the gambling industry ($500B+ global revenue) is funded entirely by player losses. Even sports bettors — often the most 'skilled' form — show that less than 5% maintain long-term profits, and professional edge cases exist only in very specific, exploitable market inefficiencies.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if I want to stop gambling?",
    a: "Practical steps: self-exclude from all gambling sites and venues (most jurisdictions have formal self-exclusion programs), delete betting apps, block gambling sites (Gamban, BetBlocker are free tools), replace the trigger behavior with an alternative, and seek support from a counsellor or support group. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has strong evidence for treating gambling disorder.",

    body: "A 5% house edge means for every $100 wagered, you lose $5 on average. That doesn't sound catastrophic — but if you play through $1,000 in an evening (betting $10 rounds), you lose around $50 in expected value. Over a year of weekly sessions, those edges compound into thousands of dollars. The math is inescapable.",

These are not character flaws — they're symptoms of a recognised addiction. Help is available and effective.",
