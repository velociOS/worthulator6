  { q: "What is FICA on my pay stub?", a: "FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It covers Social Security (6.2% of gross, up to $168,600 in 2024) and Medicare (1.45%, no limit). Your employer matches this amount." },
  { q: "What's the difference between gross and net pay?", a: "Gross pay is your salary before any deductions. Net pay (take-home) is what hits your bank account after federal tax, state tax, FICA, and benefit deductions are removed." },
  { q: "Why is my federal tax withholding different each paycheck?", a: "Variable income (overtime, bonuses, commission) changes withholding. Your W-4 settings also affect it — allowances, additional withholding, or filing status changes all impact the number." },
  { q: "What is a pre-tax deduction?", a: "Contributions to 401k, HSA, FSA, and most employer health insurance plans are pre-tax — they reduce your taxable income before federal and state taxes are calculated." },
  { q: "How do I check if my taxes are correct?", a: "Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator or run your annualised gross through a tax calculator. If you owe large amounts or get huge refunds each year, adjust your W-4." },
