const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does the average person spend on alcohol per year?",
    a: "The average American spends around $500–$600 per year on alcohol according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but frequent drinkers or those who regularly drink at bars and restaurants can easily spend $3,000–$10,000+ annually.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the 'invested value' calculated?",
    a: "The calculator assumes you invest your annual alcohol spend at the start of each year with a 7% annual return over 10 years, using the future value of an annuity formula. It represents the opportunity cost of the money spent on alcohol.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include home drinking and bar drinking?",
    a: "Yes — blend both. If you buy a case of beer at home for $30 and spend $60 at a bar in a given week, your weekly average is $90 for however many drinks that covers. The average cost per drink is the blended figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this tool trying to make me quit drinking?",
    a: "Not at all. It is simply a financial awareness tool. You may decide the enjoyment is worth every penny — that is a completely valid choice. The goal is to make the cost visible so it is a conscious decision rather than an unexamined habit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What else can I use this for?",
    a: "The same framework applies to any regular spending habit — cigarettes, vaping, takeout coffee, gambling, or any recurring purchase you want to quantify over time.",
  },

    title: "The opportunity cost",
    body: "Money spent on alcohol is money that cannot compound. At 7% annual return, $2,500/year invested grows to over $35,000 in 10 years. Over 30 years, the same habit costs over $236,000 in foregone wealth.",
