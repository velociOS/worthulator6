  description:
    "Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor formula and see your daily calorie needs for sedentary, moderate, and active lifestyles.",

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is BMR and why does it matter?",
    a: "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body burns at complete rest to maintain basic functions — breathing, circulation, cell production, and temperature regulation. It accounts for 60–75% of total daily calorie expenditure. Knowing your BMR is the starting point for setting accurate calorie targets for weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Mifflin-St Jeor formula?",
    a: "The Mifflin-St Jeor formula (published 1990) is considered the most accurate BMR formula for most adults: Male BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) + 5. Female BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) − 161. It is more accurate than the older Harris-Benedict formula, particularly for overweight individuals.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between BMR and TDEE?",
    a: "BMR is calories burned at rest. TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is calories burned including all daily activity. TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier. Sedentary (desk job, no exercise): ×1.2. Lightly active (light exercise 1–3 days): ×1.375. Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days): ×1.55. Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days): ×1.725. Extra active (physical job + training): ×1.9.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate are online BMR calculators?",
    a: "Formula-based BMR calculators are estimates — they can be 10–15% off from your actual metabolic rate. Individual factors like lean muscle mass, hormones, gut microbiome, and genetics affect metabolism beyond what any formula captures. Direct measurement (indirect calorimetry in a clinical setting) is the gold standard. For practical purposes, use the formula result as a baseline and adjust based on real-world weight changes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I use my BMR to lose weight?",
    a: "Multiply your BMR by your activity multiplier to get TDEE (your maintenance calories). To lose weight at approximately 1 lb/week, create a deficit of 500 calories/day from TDEE (1 lb of fat ≈ 3,500 kcal). Never eat below BMR for extended periods — this triggers metabolic adaptation, muscle loss, and hormonal disruption. A minimum of BMR calories is essential for organ function.",

    icon: "🔢",
    title: "BMR vs TDEE: which number to use",
    body: "BMR is the absolute minimum calories to survive. TDEE is what you actually need day-to-day. For weight management, use TDEE as your baseline: eat below it to lose weight, above it to gain. Never sustain a calorie intake below BMR — it risks muscle catabolism and metabolic slowdown over time.",
  },
  {
    icon: "💪",
    title: "Muscle raises your BMR",
    body: "Muscle tissue is metabolically expensive — it burns roughly 6–10 kcal per pound per day at rest, compared to fat tissue at 2–3 kcal. Adding 5 lbs of lean muscle raises BMR by 30–50 kcal/day — not dramatic, but meaningful over years. Resistance training raises BMR both directly (muscle mass) and indirectly (post-exercise calorie burn lasting 24–72 hours).",
  },
  {
    icon: "🎯",
    title: "Adjust every 5–10 lbs",
    body: "As your weight changes, your BMR changes too. Recalculate every time you gain or lose 5–10 lbs to keep your calorie target accurate. Failing to update leads to a stall — your deficit shrinks as you get lighter, and without recalculation you unknowingly return to maintenance calories without realising it.",
