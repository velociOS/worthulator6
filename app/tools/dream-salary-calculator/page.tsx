  { q: "How do I calculate the salary I need?", a: "Total monthly expenses (including savings) ÷ (1 − tax rate) × 12. At a 30% effective tax rate: if you need $5,000/month after tax, you need a $5,000 ÷ 0.70 × 12 = $85,700 gross salary." },
  { q: "What is the median US salary?", a: "As of 2024, the median full-time wage in the US is approximately $59,000/year ($1,135/week). This varies enormously by location — median in San Francisco is over $100K; in rural areas, under $45K." },
  { q: "How much should I be saving?", a: "The 50/30/20 rule suggests 20% of after-tax income. At minimum, most planners recommend enough to capture your full employer 401k match, then build to 15% of gross over time." },
  { q: "Does location change the salary I need?", a: "Dramatically. A $90K salary in Austin, TX provides a significantly different lifestyle than the same salary in Manhattan. Cost of living calculators can translate between cities." },
  { q: "What if my dream salary is very high?", a: "That's useful information. It tells you whether your current career path can get there, or whether you need to consider a different field, location, side income, or a lifestyle audit to bring costs down." },

  { icon: "↩️", title: "Working backwards", body: "Most people set a salary goal arbitrarily — $100K, $200K. Working backwards from actual monthly needs produces a more honest target, often different (sometimes lower, sometimes much higher) than the round-number goal." },
  { icon: "📈", title: "Lifestyle inflation is real", body: "As income rises, expenses tend to rise proportionally. Raising your salary without controlling lifestyle inflation can leave you no closer to financial security. The budget you set today is as important as the salary you earn." },

That target can be a negotiation number, a career pivot trigger, or an invitation to audit whether your 'dream' life is actually what you want." },
