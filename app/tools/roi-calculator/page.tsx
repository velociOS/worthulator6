const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between ROI and CAGR?",
    a: "ROI is the total percentage gain over the whole holding period. CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is the annualised version — how much it grew per year, on average. CAGR is more useful for comparing investments held over different time periods.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does inflation affect ROI?",
    a: "Inflation reduces the purchasing power of your gains. A 50% nominal ROI with 3% annual inflation over 10 years translates to a much lower real return — roughly 21% less purchasing power. This calculator shows both so you can see the true impact.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is fee drag and why does it matter so much?",
    a: "Fee drag is the compounded cost of annual fees. A 1% annual fee doesn't just cost you 1% — it costs you the compounded growth that money would have generated. Over 30 years, a 1% fee can reduce your portfolio by 20–25% compared to a 0% fee index fund.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a nominal vs real return?",
    a: "Nominal return is your raw percentage gain. Real return is adjusted for inflation — it shows how much more you can actually buy. Real return = (1 + nominal rate) / (1 + inflation rate) − 1.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I compare my returns to a benchmark?",
    a: "Yes. If your investment returns 8% annually but the S&P 500 returned 10%, you underperformed while taking on potentially more risk. Benchmark comparison is how professionals evaluate whether active decisions added value.",
  },
