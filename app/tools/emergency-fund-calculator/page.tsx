const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much should I have in my emergency fund?",
    a: "The standard recommendation is 3–6 months of essential living expenses. If you have dependants, variable income (freelance/self-employed), or work in a volatile industry, 6–12 months is safer. If you have very stable employment and no dependants, 3 months may suffice.",
  },
  {
    q: "What expenses should I include?",
    a: "Include only essential, non-negotiable expenses: housing, utilities, food, transport, insurance, and minimum debt payments. Do not include discretionary spending like dining out, entertainment, or holidays — those would be cut first in a real emergency.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where should I keep my emergency fund?",
    a: "A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is the gold standard: FDIC insured, liquid (accessible within 1–2 business days), and earning meaningful interest. Avoid keeping it in a standard checking account (too tempting to spend) or invested in stocks (too volatile and illiquid).",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I build an emergency fund or pay off debt first?",
    a: "Most financial planners recommend a 'starter' emergency fund of $1,000 first, then aggressively paying off high-interest debt (credit cards), then building to a full 3–6 month fund. Having some emergency savings prevents you from going back into debt when unexpected expenses hit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a credit card as an emergency fund?",
    a: "No. Credit cards are not an emergency fund — they're debt. Using a card in an emergency means paying 20%+ APR on top of the original emergency cost. A real emergency fund is liquid cash that costs you nothing to use and earns interest while you wait.",
