const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do you calculate X% of a number?",
    a: "Multiply the number by the percentage and divide by 100. For example, 20% of 500 = 500 × 20 / 100 = 100. Or just move the decimal: 20% = 0.20, so 500 × 0.20 = 100. The calculator does this instantly as you adjust the sliders.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is 15% of 200?",
    a: "15% of 200 = 200 × 0.15 = 30. After subtracting 15%: 200 − 30 = 170 (e.g. a discounted price). After adding 15%: 200 + 30 = 230 (e.g. a price with tax or tip added).",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from a percentage increase calculator?",
    a: "This calculator answers 'what is X% of Y' and shows you the result, remainder (Y minus X%), and total (Y plus X%). A percentage increase calculator answers 'by what percentage did a number change from A to B.' Both are common use cases — the tools are complementary.",
  },
  {
    q: "When would I use 'value minus percentage'?",
    a: "Use the remainder (value − X%) for discounts, markdowns, and sale prices. If a $250 jacket is 30% off, the sale price is 250 − 75 = $175. The 'remainder' output shows this directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "When would I use 'value plus percentage'?",
    a: "Use the 'value + percentage' output for calculating totals with tax, tip, or markup. If a restaurant bill is $80 and you're adding a 20% tip, the total is 80 + 16 = $96. The added-value output handles this in one step.",
