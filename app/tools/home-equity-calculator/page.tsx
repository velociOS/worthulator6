  { q: "What is home equity?", a: "Home equity is the difference between your home's current market value and your remaining mortgage balance. If your home is worth $400,000 and you owe $250,000, you have $150,000 in equity." },
  { q: "How much equity can I borrow against?", a: "Most lenders allow you to borrow up to 80–85% of your home's value (combined across your mortgage and any HELOC/HEL). This is your maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio." },
  { q: "What is LTV and why does it matter?", a: "LTV = loan balance ÷ home value × 100. Lenders use it to assess risk. Below 80% LTV qualifies for better rates and avoids PMI. Above 90% often means higher rates or stricter requirements." },
  { q: "What's the difference between a HELOC and a home equity loan?", a: "A HELOC is a revolving line of credit — you draw and repay as needed, usually with a variable rate. A home equity loan gives you a lump sum at a fixed rate. Both use your equity as collateral." },
  { q: "How do I build equity faster?", a: "Make extra principal payments on your mortgage, make home improvements that increase value, or benefit from market appreciation. Extra payments have the most direct impact on equity." },
