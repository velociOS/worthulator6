const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much water should I drink per day?",
    a: "A common guideline is 0.5 oz per pound of body weight. For a 160 lb person, that's 80 oz (about 10 glasses or 2.4 liters). Adjust upward for exercise, hot climates, illness, and pregnancy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the '8 glasses of water a day' rule hold up?",
    a: "Eight 8-oz glasses (64 oz total) is a helpful baseline but it's not individually calibrated. Body weight, activity level, climate, and diet all affect hydration needs. 8×8 is a floor, not a target for everyone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much extra water do I need when exercising?",
    a: "A common recommendation is 12 oz of additional water per 30 minutes of exercise. This calculator adds that on top of your baseline. For high-intensity workouts or hot environments, you may need 16–20 oz per 30 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does coffee count toward daily water intake?",
    a: "Moderate coffee consumption (3–4 cups) does count toward hydration — the diuretic effect is mild and doesn't cancel the water content. However, alcohol is dehydrating and does not count toward your intake. Sports drinks count but add unnecessary sugar for most people.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are signs of dehydration?",
    a: "Mild dehydration: dark urine, thirst, dry mouth, mild headache. Moderate: dizziness, reduced urine, fatigue. Severe: confusion, rapid heartbeat, no urination. Urine color is the easiest daily check — pale yellow is ideal, darker means drink more.",
  },

    title: "Dehydration affects your brain first",
    body: "Studies show that just 1–2% dehydration impairs mood, concentration, and working memory. Most people reach this level before they feel thirsty — by the time you're thirsty, you're already mildly dehydrated. Consistent intake beats reactive drinking.",

    icon: "⚖️",
    title: "Hydration and weight management",
    body: "Drinking water before meals reduces caloric intake on average. Thirst is also often mistaken for hunger — a glass of water first can prevent unnecessary snacking. Many people on fat-loss diets improve results significantly just by improving hydration.",
