const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much does a local move cost?", a: "Local moves (under 100 miles) typically cost $800–$2,500 for professional movers, or $200–$600 for a DIY truck rental. Cost varies by volume, access, and floor." },
  { q: "How much does a long-distance move cost?", a: "Interstate moves average $2,500–$5,000 for a 2-bedroom home. Cross-country moves can run $4,000–$10,000+. Weight and distance are the two main pricing factors." },
  { q: "When is the cheapest time to move?", a: "Weekdays in the middle of the month from October to April. Avoiding summer (peak season), weekends, and the start/end of months can save 20–30%." },
  { q: "What do movers typically not cover?", a: "Most movers exclude plants, food, hazardous materials, high-value jewelry, and pets. Fragile items should be noted in advance and some require additional insurance." },
  { q: "Should I tip movers?", a: "Tipping is not required but is customary — typically $20–$50 per mover for a local move, more for a long-distance or especially difficult job. Cash is preferred." },

  { icon: "🚛", title: "DIY vs professional movers", body: "DIY can save $1,000–$3,000 on labour but costs you time, physical effort, and the risk of damage. For moves over 2 bedrooms, professional movers often work out more cost-effectively than you'd expect." },
  { icon: "📅", title: "Overlap your leases", body: "Having even 2 weeks of lease overlap lets you move at a relaxed pace and clean the old place properly. The cost is usually worth avoiding the chaos of a same-day move-out/move-in." },
