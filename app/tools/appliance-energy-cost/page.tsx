const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I calculate the cost to run an appliance?",
    a:
      "Energy cost = (watts ÷ 1000) × hours used × electricity rate in $/kWh. For example, a 200W TV running 8 hours/day at $0.15/kWh costs: (200 ÷ 1000) × 8 × 0.15 = $0.24/day, or about $7.20/month.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the average US electricity rate?",
    a:
      "As of 2025, the US average is approximately $0.15–$0.17/kWh, but rates vary significantly by state. Hawaii averages ~$0.40/kWh. Louisiana averages ~$0.10/kWh. Check your electricity bill for your exact rate — it's usually listed as $/kWh or cents per kWh.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find my appliance's wattage?",
    a:
      "Check the label on the back or bottom of the appliance, the product manual, or the manufacturer's website. If the label shows amps (A) instead of watts: watts = volts × amps. Most US appliances run at 120V, so a 10A device = 1,200W.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which home appliances use the most electricity?",
    a:
      "The biggest electricity consumers are typically: electric water heaters (4,000–5,500W), central AC/heat pump (3,000–5,000W), electric dryer (5,000–6,000W), electric oven (2,000–5,000W), and refrigerators (100–800W, running 24/7). Phantom loads from standby electronics add up too.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I reduce my electricity bill?",
    a:
      "Replace old appliances with ENERGY STAR models, switch to LED lighting, install a smart thermostat, run dishwashers and washing machines during off-peak hours, unplug devices not in use, and add attic insulation. These steps can cut home energy use 20–30%.",
