const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the FIRE number?",
    a: "Your FIRE number is the amount of invested assets needed to retire and live off investment returns indefinitely. It's calculated as your annual expenses × 25, based on the 4% safe withdrawal rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 4% rule?",
    a: "The 4% rule (from the Trinity Study) states that you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio per year in retirement and your money will last 30+ years with a high probability. So $1M supports $40,000/year in spending.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is FIRE?",
    a: "FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a movement of people who aggressively save and invest to achieve financial independence — the point where work becomes optional — typically decades before traditional retirement age.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the 4% rule still valid in 2026?",
    a: "It's debated. Some researchers suggest 3–3.5% is safer given current valuations and longer retirement horizons. Others argue 4% remains valid. Using 3.5% (28× expenses) gives a more conservative FIRE number if you're planning a 40+ year retirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between FIRE and Coast FIRE?",
    a: "Full FIRE means your portfolio is large enough to withdraw from now. Coast FIRE means you've invested enough that you can stop contributing and let compound growth carry you to your FIRE number by a target retirement date — without adding another dollar.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I reach FIRE faster?",
    a: "Savings rate is the #1 driver — far more than investment returns. Someone saving 50% of income reaches FIRE in ~17 years regardless of salary. The math is simple: the more you save, the less you need to live on, which also lowers your FIRE number.",
  },

    title: "Savings rate beats income",
    body: "A high earner saving 5% and a modest earner saving 50% will reach FIRE at roughly the same time — because the FIRE number scales with spending. Cutting expenses is the fastest accelerator, both by reducing the target and increasing the savings rate.",

    title: "Lean FIRE vs Fat FIRE",
