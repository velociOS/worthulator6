              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
                In the UK, overtime pay is governed by your employment contract rather than
                statutory law. There is no legal requirement to pay a premium rate for overtime —
                as long as your total pay for all hours worked doesn&apos;t fall below the National
                Minimum Wage or National Living Wage.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-7">
                Most employers that do offer overtime pay use a rate of 1.5× (time and a half) for
                standard overtime and 2× (double time) for Sundays, Bank Holidays, or very long
                shifts. Some use a flat enhanced rate instead. Always check your contract or
                employee handbook for the exact terms that apply to you.

                Does overtime count towards pension and holiday pay in the UK?
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85] text-gray-600">
                Following changes to UK employment law, regular voluntary overtime may need to be
                included when calculating holiday pay. The rules depend on whether overtime is
                contractual or truly voluntary, and how regular it is. For pension auto-enrolment,
                overtime pay may or may not be included in &quot;qualifying earnings&quot; depending

                Overtime pay is subject to the same income tax and National Insurance contributions
                as your regular pay. If extra overtime pushes you into a higher tax band in a
                particular month, you may pay more tax on those earnings — though this typically
                evens out across the tax year under PAYE. This calculator shows gross figures only.

Employers must ensure total pay across all hours worked does not fall below the National Minimum Wage, but any premium for overtime hours above that is a contractual matter. Always check your employment contract or employee handbook.",

If you regularly work overtime, you may be entitled to holiday pay that reflects your typical earnings, not just your contracted hours.",

If your overtime pushes you over a tax band threshold in a given month, you may pay a higher rate on the excess, but this usually self-corrects over the tax year.",
