const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the latte factor?",
    a:
      "The latte factor is a personal finance concept popularized by David Bach. It refers to small, recurring daily expenses — like a $6 coffee — that add up over time. The idea is that redirecting those dollars into investments can build significant wealth through compound interest.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a daily $6 coffee cost over 30 years?",
    a:
      "A $6/day habit ($2,190/year) invested at 7% annual return grows to over $220,000 in 30 years. You'd spend only $65,700 in total — meaning you'd earn over $155,000 in compound gains.",
  },
  {
    q: "What return rate should I use?",
    a:
      "The S&P 500 has historically returned ~10% nominal or ~7% inflation-adjusted per year. Using 7% is a conservative and widely accepted assumption for long-term projections.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this about giving up coffee, or investing more?",
    a:
      "It's not necessarily about giving up anything — it's about awareness. You might choose to keep buying coffee and cut a different expense instead. The goal is to make intentional choices about where your money goes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this work for other daily habits?",
    a:
      "Yes — use it for any regular daily or weekly expense: subscription services, cigarettes, energy drinks, takeout lunches, or any recurring habit. The math is the same regardless of what you're spending on.",
