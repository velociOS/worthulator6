const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much time does the average person spend on social media?",
    a: "As of 2026, the global average is approximately 2.5 hours per day on social media. That's 912 hours (38 days) per year. In the US, the average is closer to 2 hours/day for adults, though Gen Z averages over 4 hours. Across a lifetime (say, 50 years of social media use), that's 45,600–73,000 hours — equivalent to 5–8 full years of waking life.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is scrolling social media actually harmful?",
    a: "Research is mixed but trending toward concern. Passive scrolling (consuming without engaging) is consistently linked to lower wellbeing, higher anxiety, and social comparison. Active use (messaging, creating, meaningful interaction) shows fewer negative effects. The strongest negative associations are with sleep disruption (evening blue light + stimulating content) and attention fragmentation from constant micro-interruptions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does social media affect productivity?",
    a: "A single notification can trigger a context switch that takes 23 minutes to fully recover from (Gloria Mark, UCI research). Checking social media 10 times a day means spending potentially 230 minutes in 'recovery mode.' For knowledge workers, this is one of the largest invisible productivity costs. Turning off notifications and using app timers can recover significant focused work time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What could I do with the time instead?",
    a: "If you scroll 2.5 hours/day and reclaimed even half (75 minutes), you could: read 30–40 books per year (at 30 min/day), learn a new language to conversational level in 12–18 months, complete a professional certification course, start and grow a side business, or exercise for an hour and still have time for a daily skill practice. The time exists — it's already being spent.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are practical ways to reduce social media time?",
    a: "Most effective approaches: use built-in screen time limits (iOS Screen Time / Android Digital Wellbeing) with a passcode set by someone else, delete apps from your phone and access only via browser (much more friction), turn off all notifications except calls and texts, set specific 'windows' for social media use rather than checking continuously, and do a 30-day digital detox to reset baseline compulsive checking patterns.",

    icon: "📱",
    title: "It's designed to be addictive",
    body: "Social media platforms are engineered using variable reward schedules — the same psychological mechanism as slot machines. Likes, comments, and new content arrive unpredictably, triggering dopamine responses that drive compulsive checking. This is intentional by design. The product isn't the app — it's your attention, sold to advertisers. Awareness of this mechanism is the first step in reclaiming agency over your time.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⏰",
    title: "Small daily habits compound enormously",
    body: "30 minutes less scrolling per day = 182 hours per year = 7.5 full days reclaimed. Over 10 years, that's 75 days of additional life time. Use those 30 minutes consistently on anything — reading, skill building, exercise, relationships — and the compound effect of that daily investment dwarfs the entertainment value of the content you'd have watched.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🧠",
    title: "Protect your attention architecture",
    body: "Your attention is finite and can be degraded. Heavy social media use (especially short-form video) conditions your brain toward shorter attention spans, making sustained deep work progressively harder. Periodic digital detoxes (even one week off) restore baseline attention capacity. Treat your focus as a trainable resource — and social media as the thing that depletes it most efficiently.",
