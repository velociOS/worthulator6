  },
  {
    q: "What affects dental implant costs the most?",
    a: "The number of teeth, implant brand quality, whether bone grafting is required, and your location are the biggest cost drivers. Specialist clinics charge significantly more than general dental practices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it worth travelling abroad for dental implants?",
    a: "Dental tourism can reduce costs by 50–75%. Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Thailand are popular destinations. Factor in travel costs, accommodation, and the need for follow-up appointments. Ensure the clinic is internationally accredited.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the dental implant process take?",
    a: "From initial consultation to final crown fitting, the process typically takes 3–9 months. If bone grafting is required, add another 3–6 months for healing. Same-day implants (immediate loading) are possible in some cases.",
