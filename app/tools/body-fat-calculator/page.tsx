const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How accurate is the Navy body fat method?",
    a:
      "The US Navy circumference method has a margin of error of approximately ±3–4% compared to DEXA scan (considered the gold standard). It's less accurate than hydrostatic weighing or DEXA but significantly better than BMI and far more accessible — no equipment required beyond a tape measure.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a healthy body fat percentage?",
    a:
      "For men: Essential fat = 2–5%, Athletic = 6–13%, Fit = 14–17%, Average = 18–24%, Obese = 25%+. For women: Essential = 10–13%, Athletic = 14–20%, Fit = 21–24%, Average = 25–31%, Obese = 32%+. These are general guidelines — athletic performance and health outcomes vary by individual.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I measure waist and neck for this calculator?",
    a:
      "Waist: Measure at the narrowest point (typically just above the navel for men, or at the smallest circumference for women). Keep the tape parallel to the floor and measure at the end of a normal exhale. Neck: Measure just below the larynx (Adam's apple), tape perpendicular to the spine.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between fat mass and lean mass?",
    a:
      "Fat mass = total body weight × body fat %. Lean mass = everything else — muscle, bone, organs, connective tissue, water. Lean mass is often used as a proxy for muscle mass, though they're not identical. Tracking lean mass over time shows whether you're gaining muscle or losing it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is BMI a better measure than body fat percentage?",
    a:
      "No — BMI (Body Mass Index) only accounts for height and weight, not body composition. A muscular athlete and an obese person can have the same BMI. Body fat percentage is a far more meaningful health metric. BMI is a population-level screening tool, not an individual diagnostic.",

For consistent tracking, always measure at the same time of day (morning, after using the toilet), with the same tape measure, relaxed posture, and using the same measurement landmarks. Changes over weeks matter — daily variation is noise.",

    icon: "💪",
    title: "Lean mass is more important than body fat",
    body: "Two people can have the same body fat percentage but very different health and performance profiles if their lean mass differs. Focus on building and preserving lean mass (through resistance training and adequate protein) rather than obsessing over fat percentage alone.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔬",
    title: "More accurate methods exist",
    body: "For the most accurate body fat measurement: DEXA scan ($50–$150) gives a full body composition breakdown including bone density. Hydrostatic weighing is also highly accurate. InBody or bioelectrical impedance scales are convenient but can be off by 5%+ depending on hydration levels.",
