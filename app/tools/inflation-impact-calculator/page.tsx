  { q: "What has average US inflation been historically?", a: "The US Federal Reserve targets 2% annually. The 20-year average before 2020 was ~2.2%. Post-pandemic inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 and has since moderated. Over very long periods, 3–3.5% is a reasonable planning assumption." },
  { q: "How does inflation affect savings accounts?", a: "If your savings earn 1% interest and inflation is 3%, your real return is -2%. Your balance goes up in dollars but buys less each year. Only returns that exceed the inflation rate grow real wealth." },
  { q: "What is the 'real' rate of return?", a: "Real return = nominal return − inflation rate. If your investment returns 8% and inflation is 3%, your real return is 5%. This is the return that actually matters for long-term planning." },
  { q: "What assets protect against inflation?", a: "Historically: equities, real estate, TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), commodities, and I Bonds have tended to at least keep pace with inflation. Cash and fixed-rate bonds are most vulnerable." },
  { q: "How does the Federal Reserve control inflation?", a: "Primarily through interest rates. Raising rates makes borrowing more expensive, slows spending, and cools inflation. Lowering rates stimulates growth but can increase inflation risk." },
