const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much time does the average person spend on their phone?", a: "Americans average 4.25 hours of smartphone use per day. Gen Z averages closer to 6.5 hours. Over a year, 4 hours/day = 1,460 hours — or 60 full days." },
  { q: "How do I check my actual screen time?", a: "iPhone: Settings → Screen Time. Android: Settings → Digital Wellbeing. Both show daily and weekly breakdowns by app. The first time most people look, the numbers are shocking." },
  { q: "Is all phone time bad?", a: "No — calls, maps, podcasts, productivity apps, and voice messages are often genuinely valuable. The issue is passive scroll time on social media and video apps, which is where most excess usage accumulates." },
  { q: "What are the health effects of excessive phone use?", a: "Research links high phone use with: disrupted sleep (blue light), increased anxiety and depression (social comparison), reduced attention span, neck and posture problems (text neck), and reduced in-person social connection." },
  { q: "What's the most effective way to reduce phone usage?", a: "Greyscale mode (removes colour dopamine trigger), screen time limits with a PIN someone else sets, phone-free zones (bedroom, dining table), notification purge, and keeping the phone out of reach during focused work." },

  { icon: "📱", title: "The attention economy", body: "Every app on your phone employs teams of engineers and psychologists to maximise the time you spend on it. Your attention is the product being sold to advertisers. The more you understand this, the more intentional your usage can become." },
  { icon: "🔔", title: "Compulsive checking vs deep use", body: "It's not the total hours that correlate most with negative outcomes — it's the frequency of checking. Checking your phone 86 times a day fragments attention in a way that 3 hours of deliberate use doesn't." },
  { icon: "🪞", title: "The identity shift", body: "Research shows that saying 'I'm not a heavy phone user' (identity framing) is more effective than 'I'm trying to use my phone less' (willpower framing). Behaviour changes more reliably when it's tied to how you see yourself." },
