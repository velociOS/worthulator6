const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much area does one gallon of paint cover?",
    a: "One gallon of standard interior latex paint covers approximately 350–400 square feet on a smooth, previously-painted surface. This calculator uses the industry-standard 350 sq ft per gallon to give a slightly conservative estimate — better to have a little extra than run short.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I always need two coats?",
    a: "For most repaints (same or similar colour on a previously painted wall), two coats gives full, even coverage. One coat is often sufficient if you're refreshing with the exact same colour. Three coats may be needed when going from a dark to a very light colour, or painting over raw drywall or fresh plaster.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I measure my room's wall area?",
    a: "Measure the length and width of the room in feet. Wall area = 2 × (length + width) × ceiling height. Then subtract ~21 sq ft for each standard door and ~15 sq ft for each standard window. This calculator does all of that automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the calculator add a 10% buffer?",
    a: "A 10% buffer accounts for spills, uneven application, touch-ups after the first coat dries, and rounding errors in your measurements. Paint is cheap relative to a second store trip mid-project. The buffer amount is always shown separately so you can decide whether to include it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does paint coverage differ between brands and finishes?",
    a: "Yes — higher-quality paints often have better coverage (closer to 400 sq ft/gal) and may require fewer coats. Flat and matte finishes tend to cover slightly better than gloss finishes. Premium paints marketed as 'one-coat coverage' can sometimes do the job in one coat over similar colours, but two coats is safer for consistency.",

    body: "A common mistake is confusing floor area with wall area. A 12 × 14 ft room has 168 sq ft of floor — but over 450 sq ft of wall if ceilings are 9 ft. Wall area is always larger than floor area in any standard room. Always measure from the walls up.",

    title: "Doors and windows mean less paint needed",
    body: "A standard interior door is roughly 21 sq ft (7 ft × 3 ft). A standard window is roughly 15 sq ft (3 ft × 5 ft). On a room with 2 doors and 3 windows, that's 87 sq ft you don't need to paint — potentially saving a full gallon on a large project.",

  {
    icon: "🖌️",
    title: "Buy in the right can size",
    body: "Paint typically comes in quart (0.25 gal), one-gallon, and five-gallon containers. Five-gallon buckets are cheapest per gallon but wasteful for small rooms. If your estimate lands between sizes, round up one size — leftover paint is useful for future touch-ups.",
