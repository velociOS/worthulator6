const FAQS = [
  { q: "How much does a typical relationship cost per year?", a: "Surveys suggest couples spend $8,000–$12,000 per year on date nights, gifts, holidays, and shared expenses. Long-term partners often spend more as lifestyle expectations align upward." },
  { q: "Who typically pays more in a relationship?", a: "Traditionally, men spent more on early dating. Today it varies widely — about 50% of couples split evenly, 30% have one partner pay more, and 20% use hybrid approaches." },
  { q: "How much does an average date cost?", a: "A dinner date at a mid-range restaurant averages $60–$90 for two. Add a movie and it's $100–$120. Special occasion dates (concerts, events) can run $200–$400." },
  { q: "Is talking about money in a relationship a red flag?", a: "The opposite. Financial misalignment is a leading cause of relationship breakdown. Couples who openly discuss money have stronger relationships and better outcomes, according to multiple studies." },
  { q: "Should I factor in shared savings?", a: "This calculator focuses on the expenditure side. The wealth-building side of a committed relationship (shared mortgage, combined investing, economies of scale) often far outweighs the costs over time." },
