            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Your take home pay — sometimes called your after-tax salary or net income — is what lands in your bank account after your employer has deducted federal income tax, state income tax (where applicable), and payroll taxes. Understanding how each piece works makes it easier to plan your finances around what you actually earn.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Federal income tax is calculated on your taxable income using a progressive bracket system — only the portion of your salary within each bracket is taxed at that bracket&apos;s rate. On top of that, FICA contributions cover Social Security (6.2% up to an annual wage base of $168,600) and Medicare (1.45% on all earnings). If your state has an income tax, that is calculated separately and added to your total deductions.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              For most workers earning $40,000–$80,000 in a moderate-tax state, take-home tends to work out to roughly 60–68% of gross income. Adjust for your state and filing status above to see where you land.

              Married couples filing jointly have wider brackets — roughly double the thresholds for the 10% through 22% bands — which often results in a meaningfully higher take-home compared to two single filers at the same combined income.

              Payroll taxes add another layer: Social Security at 6.2% on earnings up to $168,600 and Medicare at 1.45% with no ceiling. Together these represent an additional 7.65% on most earned income.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">How state taxes affect your take-home pay</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              State income tax can have a surprisingly large effect on your net income. Nine states — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming — charge no income tax on wages at all. In those states, your take-home is determined almost entirely by your federal bracket and FICA obligations.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              At the other end, states like California (up to 13.3%), New Jersey (up to 10.75%), and New York (up to 10.9%) add a significant deduction on top of federal obligations. On a $100,000 salary, the difference between a no-tax state and California can amount to $8,000–$10,000 in annual take-home — roughly one month&apos;s salary.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Most states sit somewhere in the middle, charging between 3% and 6%. Select your state in the calculator above to see exactly how the combined federal and state rate affects your situation.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">Example take-home salaries in the US</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Someone earning around $50,000 in a moderate-tax state (roughly 5% state income tax) will typically take home somewhere between $33,000 and $35,000 per year — around 66–70% of their gross. The exact figure depends on their federal bracket, filing status, and whether they have pre-tax deductions like 401(k) contributions.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              Higher incomes see a somewhat lower take-home percentage. Someone earning $75,000 might keep around 63–65% after all deductions, while a $100,000 earner typically takes home somewhere in the 60–63% range as more income falls into the 22–24% federal brackets. The US progressive system means only earnings above each threshold are taxed at the higher rate — but the gap between gross and net does widen noticeably at higher salary levels.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-[1.85]">
              In a no-income-tax state like Texas or Florida, these percentages are typically 4–7 points higher. In a high-tax state like California or New York, they can be 5–8 points lower. Select your state in the calculator to see a figure that reflects where you actually live.
