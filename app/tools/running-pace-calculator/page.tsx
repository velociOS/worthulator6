const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a good running pace?",
    a: "For casual runners, 10–12 min/mile (6:13–7:27 min/km) is a comfortable jogging pace. For recreational 5K runners, 8–10 min/mile. Competitive amateur runners typically aim for 7–9 min/mile. Elite runners sustain under 5 min/mile for a full marathon. 'Good' depends entirely on your fitness level and goal.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate pace per mile from total time?",
    a: "Pace (min/mile) = Total Time (minutes) ÷ Distance (miles). For example, finishing a 10K (6.2 miles) in 50 minutes gives a pace of 50 ÷ 6.2 = 8:04 per mile. This calculator does that division instantly, plus converts to min/km as well.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between pace and speed?",
    a: "Speed is how far you go per unit of time (e.g. 7 mph). Pace is how long it takes to cover a unit of distance (e.g. 8:34 per mile). Runners typically use pace — it maps directly to race planning. 'I need to run 9-minute miles to finish the 10K in under an hour' is more actionable than a speed figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I convert pace per mile to pace per km?",
    a: "Divide your min/mile pace by 1.60934. For example, 8:00 min/mile ÷ 1.60934 = 4:58 min/km. This calculator shows both automatically so you can work in whichever unit you prefer.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I use this to plan a race?",
    a: "Enter your target distance and the finish time you're aiming for. The calculator shows the pace you need to maintain consistently throughout the race. Many runners find it useful to aim slightly faster than this pace to account for slower start/finish miles and elevation changes.",

    body: "Going out too fast in the first mile is the most common race mistake.

Use this calculator to find your target pace and practise holding it.",

  {
    icon: "📏",
    title: "Train at different paces for different goals",
    body: "Not all training runs should be at race pace. Easy runs (60–70% max heart rate) build aerobic base. Tempo runs (slightly faster than race pace) build lactate threshold. Speed intervals (much faster) improve VO2 max. Use this tool to find your race pace — then train at multiples of it.",

    title: "Pace is the language of race planning",
    body: "Once you know your target pace, you can plan every mile split of a race — factoring in elevation, water stops, and the effort to negative-split the second half. Pace converts an abstract time goal into a concrete per-mile target you can train for.",

          "Once you have your pace, use it to set up training. Your long easy runs should be 60–90 seconds per mile slower than race pace. Tempo runs (lactate threshold work) should be 20–30 seconds per mile faster. Speed intervals can be 60–90 seconds per mile faster. The race pace number from this calculator anchors all of those targets.",
