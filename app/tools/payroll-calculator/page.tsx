const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the true cost of an employee beyond salary?",
    a: "The true cost is typically 1.25–1.4× the gross salary. On top of base pay, employers pay payroll taxes (FICA is 7.65% in the US), plus benefits like health insurance, 401k matching, paid leave, and workers' compensation. A $60,000 salary often costs $75,000–$84,000 all-in.",
  },
  {
    q: "What employer payroll taxes do I need to pay in the US?",
    a: "US employers pay: Social Security (6.2% on wages up to $176,100 in 2026), Medicare (1.45%, plus 0.9% on wages over $200k), FUTA (6% on first $7,000, often reduced to 0.6% with state credits), and SUTA (state unemployment, varies by state and claims history, typically 1–5%).",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I reduce payroll costs without cutting salaries?",
    a: "Options include: switching to a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) with an HSA, restructuring benefits packages, using a PEO (Professional Employer Organization) for group rates, offering equity instead of cash bonuses, and reviewing your FUTA/SUTA classification to minimize unemployment tax rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is payroll burden and why does it matter?",
    a: "Payroll burden is the total additional cost above gross salary — taxes plus benefits. It matters for budgeting, pricing, and profitability. A business charging clients for staff time must mark up by the burden rate or it will lose money. Typical burden rates range from 18–35% of base salary.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I run payroll for employees?",
    a: "The most common pay frequencies in the US are bi-weekly (every two weeks, 26 pay periods per year) and semi-monthly (twice a month, 24 pay periods). Weekly payroll is common in hourly roles; monthly payroll is less common but used in some white-collar industries. Each frequency has different cash flow and processing cost implications.",

    body: "When you hire someone at $60,000, the actual cost is closer to $75,000–$84,000 once you add payroll taxes, health insurance, 401k matching, paid time off, and workers' compensation. Budget for the burden, not just the offer letter number.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📊",
    title: "Use cost-per-head for pricing and planning",
    body: "Agencies, consultancies, and service businesses should divide total workforce cost by billable hours to get a true cost per hour. If your all-in cost is $80,000/year and an employee works 1,800 billable hours, your cost is $44/hr before overhead — meaning your billing rate must be significantly higher to be profitable.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⚠️",
    title: "SUTA rates spike with layoffs",
    body: "State unemployment tax (SUTA) rates are experience-rated — meaning if your company has a history of layoffs, your SUTA rate increases. New employers typically start at a default rate (often 2–3%), but it can climb above 10% for businesses with frequent terminations. Budget conservatively if your workforce is seasonal or project-based.",
