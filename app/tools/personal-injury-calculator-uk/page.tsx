                How UK personal injury compensation estimates are calculated
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, personal
                injury compensation is typically divided into two categories:{" "}
                <strong>general damages</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>special damages</strong>.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                <strong>General damages</strong> cover pain, suffering and loss
                of amenity (PSLA). These are non-financial losses and are
                assessed using the{" "}
                <em>Judicial College Guidelines (JCG)</em>, a publication used
                by courts throughout England and Wales as a reference for
                typical compensation ranges across different injury types and
                severities. Our estimates are based on approximate JCG ranges
                and are intended to give a general indication only.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                <strong>Special damages</strong> cover quantifiable financial
                losses such as medical treatment costs, lost earnings, future
                care expenses and property damage. Unlike general damages,
                special damages require documented evidence and are specific to
                each individual&apos;s circumstances.

                This calculator presents three figures:{" "}

                <strong>most likely</strong>, and{" "}
                <strong>maximum estimate</strong>. These reflect different
                scenarios based on typical UK case data — they do not

              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                A conservative estimate reflects a lower-end outcome, such as
                an early resolution or a case where evidence is limited. The
                most likely figure represents a typical outcome with reasonable
                evidence and legal representation. The maximum estimate
                reflects a scenario where all factors are favourable and
                damages are assessed at the upper end of published ranges.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                In all cases, these are estimates based on similar historical
                cases and publicly available data. Your individual circumstances
                may result in a figure above, below or within these ranges.

              <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                A compensation calculator is a useful starting point for
                understanding the general scale of potential compensation
                ranges for your type of injury. However, it is important to
                treat any figure as an estimate rather than a prediction or
                guarantee.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
                Here are some steps you may wish to consider independently:

                  <span>
                    <strong>Gather documentation.</strong> Medical records,
                    receipts for expenses incurred, payslips showing lost
                    earnings, photographs and any correspondence relating to
                    the incident can all be relevant to a claim.

                    <strong>Research limitation periods.</strong> In England
                    and Wales, most personal injury claims must be brought
                    within three years of the incident (or the date you became
                    aware of your injury). Time limits vary for certain claim
                    types and for children. Delays can affect your ability to
                    pursue a claim.
