  {
    q: "How much can I make on Airbnb?",
    a:
      "It varies widely by location, property type, and management effort. Urban apartments in major cities can earn $2,000–$5,000+/month. Suburban homes typically earn $1,000–$3,000/month. Rural or seasonal properties might earn $500–$2,000/month during peak season.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good Airbnb occupancy rate?",
    a:
      "Urban markets often see 60–75% occupancy for well-managed properties. Beach and mountain vacation rentals typically average 40–60% due to seasonality. Anything above 70% is considered strong. Most hosts aim for 65–70%.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Airbnb's host service fee?",
    a:
      "Airbnb typically charges hosts a 3% service fee per booking. However, if you opt for Airbnb's Plus or host-only fee structure, it can be higher. Vrbo and other platforms charge 8–15%. This calculator lets you set your exact fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "What expenses should I include?",
    a:
      "Include: mortgage or rent, utilities, Wi-Fi, cleaning fees (if you don't charge separately), restocking supplies (toiletries, linens), insurance, property management fees (if applicable), and any HOA fees. Many hosts underestimate expenses initially.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Airbnb income taxable?",
    a:
      "Yes — short-term rental income is generally taxable. However, you can deduct a proportional share of mortgage interest, utilities, cleaning, supplies, depreciation, and other business expenses. Consult a tax professional, especially for the 14-day rental rule.",
