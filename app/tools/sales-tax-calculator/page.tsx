  {
    q: "What is the average US sales tax rate?",
    a: "The average combined state and local sales tax rate in the US is about 7.12% in 2026. State rates range from 0% (Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire, Delaware) to 9.55% (Tennessee). Add local rates and the total can exceed 10% in some cities.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is sales tax calculated on the pre-tax or post-tax price?",
    a: "Always on the pre-tax (listed) price. The tax is a percentage of the base price, added on top. So a $100 item at 8.5% tax = $8.50 tax, for a total of $108.50.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do all states have sales tax?",
    a: "No — Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Alaska have no statewide sales tax. However, some Alaskan localities still charge local sales tax. Always check your local jurisdiction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is sales tax charged on services?",
    a: "It depends on the state. Most states tax tangible goods. Services like haircuts, legal advice, and consulting are taxed in some states but not others. Digital goods and software are increasingly taxed as states update their laws.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find my state's exact sales tax rate?",
    a: "The Tax Foundation publishes up-to-date state sales tax tables. Your state's Department of Revenue website is the most accurate source for combined state + local rates in your specific zip code.",
