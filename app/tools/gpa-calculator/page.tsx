const FAQS = [
  { q: "How is GPA calculated?", a: "GPA = total quality points ÷ total credit hours. Quality points = grade points × credit hours per course. A 4.0 scale uses A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0." },
  { q: "Can I raise my GPA in one semester?", a: "Yes, but the math gets harder as more credits accumulate. With 60 credits completed, you'd need perfect 4.0s for many semesters to move from a 3.2 to a 3.7." },
  { q: "What GPA do I need for graduate school?", a: "Most programmes require 3.0 minimum, competitive programmes often expect 3.5+. Some top programmes consider the last 60 credits only, which can help if your early grades were weak." },
  { q: "What's the difference between semester and cumulative GPA?", a: "Semester GPA covers just that term. Cumulative GPA is your overall average across all credits. This calculator works with cumulative GPA." },
  { q: "Does GPA matter after graduation?", a: "For most careers, it matters least 3–5 years after graduation. For law school, medical school, and finance, it can remain important for years. Internships and work experience often outweigh GPA over time." },
