const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is future value?",
    a: "Future value is what a sum of money today will be worth at a specific point in the future, assuming it grows at a given rate. It accounts for both your initial deposit and any regular contributions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does compound interest work?",
    a: "Compound interest means you earn interest on your interest. Each month, your balance grows — and the next month's interest is calculated on that larger balance. Over decades, this creates exponential growth.",
  },
  {
    q: "What return rate should I use?",
    a: "The US stock market (S&P 500) has returned roughly 7–10% per year on average historically (7% inflation-adjusted). Use a lower rate for bonds or savings accounts, higher for more aggressive assumptions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this include inflation?",
    a: "No — this calculator shows nominal future value. To get real (inflation-adjusted) future value, subtract roughly 2–3% from your expected return rate before calculating.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does monthly contribution matter so much?",
    a: "Even a small regular contribution compounds dramatically over time. $200/mo at 7% for 30 years grows to over $240,000 — compared to $0 with no contributions on the same initial deposit.",

    title: "Starting early vs starting late",
    body: "Someone who invests $200/mo from age 25 to 65 ends up with roughly twice as much as someone who starts at 35, even though they invested for 10 fewer years. The difference is compounding time.",
