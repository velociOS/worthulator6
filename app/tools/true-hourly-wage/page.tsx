const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the true hourly wage?",
    a:
      "Your true hourly wage is your salary divided by all the hours your job actually requires — including your commute, getting ready for work, and time spent decompressing from work stress. It's almost always lower than your official rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does commute time matter for hourly rate?",
    a:
      "Commute time is unpaid but it's directly caused by your job. A one-hour daily round trip adds ~250 hours per year to your job-related time. For a $60,000 salary worker, that alone can reduce the effective rate by $5–$8/hr.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts as decompression time?",
    a:
      "Decompression time is the period after work where you're too mentally drained to do anything productive — scrolling your phone, zoning out, or just recovering. Many people spend 30–90 minutes per day in this state due to work stress.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does this affect job decisions?",
    a:
      "A remote job paying $75,000 can easily beat a $90,000 office job once you account for zero commute costs and time savings. This calculator helps you make apples-to-apples comparisons between job offers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include getting ready for work?",
    a:
      "Yes, if you dress or prepare differently for work than you would otherwise, that time is job-related. People in professional settings often spend 20–40 minutes daily on work-specific preparation.",
