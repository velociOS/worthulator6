const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is compound interest?",
    a: "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest (which only applies to the original principal), compound interest causes your balance to grow exponentially over time. The more frequently interest compounds — daily, monthly, quarterly — the faster your money grows. Einstein is often (apocryphally) credited with calling it 'the eighth wonder of the world'.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I contribute to an investment account?",
    a: "Monthly contributions are the most practical and impactful approach for most investors. Investing consistently every month — regardless of market conditions — is called dollar-cost averaging. It removes emotion from investing, smooths out market volatility, and maximises your time in the market. Even small consistent contributions dramatically outperform irregular lump sums over 20+ year horizons thanks to compounding.",
  },
  {
    q: "What interest rate should I expect from investments?",
    a: "The S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return of approximately 7–10% historically (adjusted for inflation: ~7%). Bond-heavy or balanced portfolios typically return 4–6%. High-yield savings accounts and cash ISAs currently yield 4–5% with low risk. The 'right' rate depends entirely on your risk tolerance and time horizon — longer horizons can weather higher-volatility, higher-return assets like equities.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does inflation reduce my investment returns?",
    a: "Yes — inflation erodes purchasing power. If your investment earns 7% per year and inflation runs at 2.5%, your real (inflation-adjusted) return is approximately 4.4% (nominal rate minus inflation rate). This is why long-term investors focus on real returns, not nominal ones. Use the inflation adjustment toggle in the calculator above to see what your future balance is worth in today's money.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I reinvest earnings from my investments?",
    a: "Almost always, yes. Reinvesting dividends and interest is what drives compound growth. If you withdraw your earnings, you lose the compounding effect — your balance grows linearly instead of exponentially. Most modern investment platforms (brokerages, ISA providers, 401k plans) automatically reinvest dividends by default. Over 30 years, reinvesting dividends can account for more than 40% of total returns.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does tax affect my investment returns?",
    a: "Tax on investment gains varies by account type and jurisdiction. In a taxable account in the US, long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income. In the UK, gains above the annual exempt amount are taxed at 10% (basic rate) or 20% (higher rate). However, tax-advantaged accounts — Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, 401(k) in the US; ISA in the UK — shelter your gains from tax entirely or defer them. Maximising contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts is almost always the optimal strategy.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Rule of 72?",
    a: "The Rule of 72 is a quick mental shortcut to estimate how long it takes to double your money. Simply divide 72 by your annual interest rate: at 6%, your money doubles in approximately 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). At 9%, it doubles in 8 years. The rule works reasonably well for rates between 2% and 20%. Our calculator shows you the exact doubling year based on your inputs.",

              How does compound interest work?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Compound interest means your interest earns interest. In the first period, you earn
              interest on your principal. In the second period, you earn interest on your
              principal <em>plus</em> the interest already accumulated. This self-reinforcing loop
              is why investment growth looks like a hockey stick curve rather than a straight line.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The standard compound interest formula for a lump sum is:
            </p>
            <div className="my-4 rounded-xl bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 px-5 py-4 font-mono text-sm text-gray-700">
              A = P × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)
            </div>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">
              Where: A = final amount, P = principal, r = annual interest rate (as a decimal),
              n = compounding periods per year, t = time in years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              But most real-world investors also make regular contributions — not just a one-time
              lump sum. Adding monthly contributions transforms the formula into a future value
              of annuity calculation. Our calculator handles both simultaneously, giving you a
              complete picture of investment growth including every monthly deposit.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The early starter contributes just $24,000 more — but ends up with over $285,000
              more at retirement. That gap is entirely due to compounding. Starting a decade
              earlier more than doubles the final balance, which is why financial advisers
              consistently emphasise beginning to invest as early as possible.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-950 tracking-tight mb-4">
              The impact of regular monthly contributions
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              A lump-sum investment grows through compounding, but adding regular monthly
              contributions amplifies the effect significantly. Each monthly deposit starts its
              own compounding clock. A $10,000 lump sum invested at 7% for 20 years grows to
              approximately $38,700. The same $10,000 <em>plus</em> $200 each month grows to
              roughly $114,000 — nearly three times as much.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Monthly contributions also smooth out market timing risk. Rather than putting
              everything in at one moment (which might coincide with a market peak), regular
              contributions automatically purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer
              when prices are high — a strategy known as pound-cost averaging in the UK and
              dollar-cost averaging in the US.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Even small increases in monthly contributions compound powerfully over decades.
              Increasing contributions by just $50/month — roughly the cost of two restaurant
              meals — adds approximately $60,000 to a 30-year investment projection at 7%.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-950 tracking-tight mb-4">
              How inflation affects your real investment returns
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Inflation is the silent tax on investment returns. If your portfolio grows at 7%
              per year but inflation averages 3%, your real (purchasing power) return is only
              about 4%. The future dollar figure shown in most calculators is a <em>nominal</em>{" "}
              figure — what your account will say in twenty years. The inflation-adjusted figure
              tells you what that money can actually buy in today&apos;s terms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              For long-term planning, the inflation-adjusted return is almost always the more
              meaningful number. A balance of $500,000 in 30 years at 2.5% average inflation
              is worth only about $238,000 in today&apos;s money. This is why most financial planners
              target a real return of 4–5% rather than focusing on nominal rates.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Asset classes that historically outpace inflation include equities (stocks),
              real estate investment trusts (REITs), and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
              (TIPS). Cash and short-term bonds have historically failed to keep pace with
              inflation over long periods, eroding purchasing power gradually.

              Compounding frequency: does it matter?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn — but the difference
              between monthly and daily compounding is surprisingly small in practice. On a
              $10,000 investment at 7% for 20 years, monthly compounding produces $39,343 while
              daily compounding produces $39,525 — a difference of just $182. The frequency of
              your <em>contributions</em> matters far more than the compounding frequency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Most investment accounts (brokerage, ISA, pension) compound monthly or daily.
              Savings accounts and money market funds typically compound daily. The calculator
              above lets you toggle between monthly, quarterly, and annual compounding so you
              can see the effect on your specific projection.
