const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much cheaper is it to drive an EV?",
    a:
      "For the average US driver doing 12,000 miles/year, driving an EV saves approximately $800–$1,500 per year in fuel compared to a 28 MPG gas car — depending on your electricity rate and local gas prices.",
  },
  {
    q: "What electricity rate should I use?",
    a:
      "The US average is roughly $0.13–0.16 per kWh, but rates vary significantly by state. Check your monthly electricity bill for your local rate. Some utilities offer off-peak EV charging rates as low as $0.06/kWh.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this include EV charging infrastructure costs?",
    a:
      "No — this calculator focuses on per-mile fuel costs only. It doesn't include home charger installation (~$500–$1,500), public fast-charging costs, or the cost premium of purchasing an EV over a comparable gas vehicle.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which EVs are most efficient?",
    a:
      "The most efficient EVs use around 24–28 kWh per 100 miles (Tesla Model 3, Chevy Bolt, Hyundai Ioniq 6). Larger SUVs and trucks typically use 30–40+ kWh/100mi. Check the EPA's fueleconomy.gov for specific vehicle ratings.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is EV charging cheaper than gas at home vs public stations?",
    a:
      "Home charging is almost always cheaper than public DC fast charging (DCFC), which can cost $0.30–$0.50/kWh or more — sometimes rivaling gas costs. The big savings come from overnight home charging at standard utility rates.",
