const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much protein do I need per day?",
    a: "Protein needs depend on your body weight and activity level. General guidelines: sedentary adults need 0.8g/kg (minimum RDA); recreationally active people need 1.2–1.6g/kg; those building muscle with resistance training need 1.6–2.0g/kg; elite athletes and hard-trainers may benefit from 2.0–2.4g/kg. These are per kilogram of body weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I calculate protein based on body weight or lean mass?",
    a: "For accuracy, base protein on lean body mass (total weight minus fat mass) rather than total weight — especially if body fat percentage is high. However, for simplicity, total body weight is an acceptable and commonly used starting point. If your body fat is above 30%, consider using your goal body weight as the basis instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I eat too little protein?",
    a: "Protein deficiency impairs muscle repair, immune function, hormone production, and enzyme activity. In a calorie deficit, insufficient protein accelerates muscle loss (catabolism). Ensuring adequate protein while dieting is critical for preserving lean mass and maintaining metabolic rate. Most people eating whole foods meet the 0.8g/kg RDA but fall short of performance-optimised levels.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you eat too much protein?",
    a: "For healthy adults with normal kidney function, high protein intakes (up to 3g/kg) appear safe in research. The concern about protein damaging kidneys applies primarily to people with pre-existing kidney disease. Excessive protein may displace other important macronutrients if taken to extremes. Practically, eating above 2.4g/kg adds no further muscle-building benefit for most people.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the best sources of protein?",
    a: "Complete proteins (all essential amino acids): chicken breast (~31g/100g), Greek yoghurt (~10g/100g), eggs (~13g/100g), canned tuna (~25g/100g), cottage cheese (~11g/100g), lentils (~9g/100g, plant-based). For convenience: whey protein powder (~25g/scoop), edamame (~11g/100g). Aim to get the majority of protein from whole food sources rather than supplements.",

    icon: "🍗",
    title: "Distribute protein throughout the day",
    body: "Research suggests muscle protein synthesis is maximised when protein is spread across 3–5 meals of 20–40g each, rather than consumed in one large serving. Your body can only effectively use approximately 40g per meal for muscle building — consuming 100g in one sitting doesn't produce 2.5× the benefit. Aim for protein at every main meal.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⏰",
    title: "Protein timing around workouts",
    body: "The 'anabolic window' is real but wider than once thought. Consuming 20–40g of high-quality protein within 2 hours post-workout supports muscle protein synthesis. Pre-workout protein (within 1–2 hours before) is equally effective. The most important factor is total daily protein — timing matters less than hitting your daily target consistently.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🌱",
    title: "Plant-based protein requires more planning",
    body: "Plant proteins are generally less bioavailable and often incomplete (missing one or more essential amino acids). To compensate, plant-based eaters should aim for the higher end of protein targets (1.8–2.2g/kg) and combine protein sources throughout the day. Soy, quinoa, and hemp are complete plant proteins. Combining rice + beans or peanut butter + whole grain covers all essential amino acids.",
