const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a sleep cycle?",
    a: "A sleep cycle lasts roughly 90 minutes and includes four stages: light sleep (N1, N2), deep slow-wave sleep (N3), and REM sleep. Your brain completes 4–6 cycles per night, with deep sleep dominating early cycles and REM sleep dominating later ones.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do I feel groggy even after 8 hours?",
    a: "Grogginess — officially called sleep inertia — happens when your alarm wakes you mid-cycle, usually during deep sleep (N3). Waking at the end of a full cycle, even with slightly fewer total hours, is almost always more refreshing than waking mid-cycle after more time asleep.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does this calculator add sleep onset time?",
    a: "Most people take 5–20 minutes to fall asleep after lying down. If you calculate bedtime as 'wake-up minus 7.5 hours' and get into bed at that time, you're actually shortchanging yourself by your onset time. The calculator adds it so the bedtime shown is when you should get into bed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 7.5 hours (5 cycles) better than 9 hours (6 cycles)?",
    a: "For most healthy adults, 5–6 complete cycles (7.5–9 hours) is optimal. The right number depends on your age, activity level, and how rested you feel. If you consistently feel unrefreshed after 5 cycles, try 6. If 5 leaves you feeling great, you probably don't need 6.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I can't fall asleep at the calculated bedtime?",
    a: "Use the 4-cycle bedtime (6 hours) as your fall-back — it's still a complete number of cycles. Avoid screens 30–60 minutes before bed, keep your room cool (65–68°F is optimal), and try to maintain a consistent wake time even on weekends, which anchors your circadian rhythm.",

    icon: "🔄",
    title: "Cycles matter more than total hours",
    body: "Eight hours sounds like a round, satisfying number — but if your alarm fires mid-cycle, you'll feel terrible. The goal is to complete whole cycles, not hit an arbitrary hour count. This is why some people feel great on 7.5 hours but awful on 8.",
  },
  {
    icon: "⏰",
    title: "Waking mid-cycle causes sleep inertia",
    body: "Sleep inertia — the heavy, confused grogginess after waking — is caused by interrupting deep sleep (N3). It can last 30–60 minutes and impairs reaction time, memory, and mood. Waking at the natural end of a cycle eliminates most of it.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🌙",
    title: "Consistent timing beats perfect timing",
    body: "The single most effective sleep intervention is a fixed wake time — even on weekends. A consistent wake time anchors your circadian rhythm, gradually shifting your natural sleep onset earlier. Within a few weeks, falling asleep at your calculated bedtime becomes natural.",

Each cycle takes the brain through light sleep, deep slow-wave sleep, and REM — all of which serve different restorative functions.
