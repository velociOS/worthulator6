const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is the 4% rule for retirement?",
    a: "The 4% rule (Trinity Study, 1998) states that a retiree can withdraw 4% of their portfolio per year and have a very high probability (95%+) of not running out of money over a 30-year retirement, assuming a diversified stock/bond portfolio. This means your retirement target = annual expenses × 25. Spend $40,000/year → need $1,000,000. Spend $60,000/year → need $1,500,000. The rule was based on historical US market data; debate continues about whether 3.5% is more appropriate for longer retirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is FIRE and how does this calculator support it?",
    a: "FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. The movement focuses on aggressive saving (40–70%+ of income) and frugal living to reach financial independence decades ahead of traditional retirement age. This calculator uses the core FIRE math: determine your 'FI number' (expenses × 25) and model how long your current savings rate takes to reach it at an assumed market return rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a realistic annual investment return to use?",
    a: "Common assumptions: 7% = US stock market long-run real return (inflation-adjusted); 10% = nominal US market return; 5–6% = conservative assumption for a balanced portfolio; 4% = very conservative for bond-heavy portfolios. Most FIRE calculators use 7% as a real return baseline. This calculator lets you adjust the return to model different scenarios.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I reduce my years to retirement?",
    a: "Two levers: increase your savings rate or reduce your target expenses. Reducing annual expenses by $5,000 saves $125,000 from your FI number AND frees up more money to invest annually — a double benefit. Increasing income and saving the difference is the other major lever. The savings rate is the most powerful variable in the FIRE equation: going from a 20% to a 50% savings rate roughly halves the time to financial independence.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after I hit my FIRE number?",
    a: "Reaching your FI number means your investment portfolio can theoretically sustain your expenses indefinitely (at the 4% withdrawal rate). Most FIRE adherents aim for 'lean FIRE' (minimal expenses) or 'fat FIRE' (comfortable spending). 'Coast FIRE' is a milestone where you stop contributing and let existing savings compound to a future FI number. 'Barista FIRE' involves part-time work for social connection and health insurance while investments grow.",

    title: "Your FIRE number is just expenses × 25",
    body: "The simplicity of the 4% rule is what made it powerful. Annual expenses × 25 = your target portfolio. The math works because a 4% annual withdrawal from a 7%-returning portfolio leaves 3% to offset inflation and portfolio growth. Keeping expenses low has a compounding double benefit: smaller FIRE number AND more money available to invest each year.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📈",
    title: "Savings rate is the key variable",
    body: "Traditional retirement advice (save 10–15% of income) leads to retiring at 60–65. Saving 25% gets you there in 32 years. Saving 50% in 17 years. Saving 75% in under 10 years. The relationship is highly non-linear: small increases in savings rate early in your career have outsized effects on retirement age. Starting a few years earlier matters far more than investment returns.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🛡️",
    title: "Build flexibility into your plan",
    body: "Most FIRE practitioners build a buffer: targeting 3.5% withdrawal rate (FI number = expenses × 28.5), having part-time or side income to supplement in early retirement years, and keeping 1–3 years of expenses in cash/bonds to avoid selling stocks in a downturn. The 4% rule works — but building in margin of safety improves resilience against sequence-of-returns risk.",
