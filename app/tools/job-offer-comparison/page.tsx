const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How do I compare two job offers fairly?",
    a:
      "Look beyond base salary. Calculate the true effective compensation by adding benefits value (health insurance, 401k match, equity, PTO), then subtracting real costs like commute expenses and any out-of-pocket benefit costs. A lower-salary remote job can easily beat a higher-salary in-office role.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I value health insurance and benefits?",
    a:
      "Estimate the annual cost of replacing each benefit on the open market. Family health insurance costs ~$6,000–$10,000/year if you paid for it yourself. A 4% 401k match on a $80K salary = $3,200/year. Unlimited PTO policies are harder to value — compare realistically.",
  },
  {
    q: "What commute costs should I include?",
    a:
      "Annual commute costs include: gas or public transit fares, parking, vehicle wear (~$0.10/mile for maintenance/depreciation beyond gas). A 30-mile round trip × 250 work days × $0.20/mile = $1,500/year just in vehicle costs, before parking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I factor in career growth potential?",
    a:
      "This calculator focuses on immediate financial comparison. Career growth, company culture, work-life balance, and learning opportunities are equally important but harder to quantify. Use this tool for the financial picture, then weigh intangibles separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if one job has equity or stock options?",
    a:
      "Include expected equity value in the benefits field — but be conservative. For startups, assume 0 unless you have strong conviction about an exit. For public company RSUs, use the current stock price × annual vesting schedule as the annual value.",
