const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much car can I afford?",
    a: "The 15% rule: your total monthly car payment (loan + insurance + fuel) should not exceed 15–20% of your take-home pay. This calculator uses 15% of gross monthly income as the max monthly payment benchmark.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 20/4/10 rule for car buying?",
    a: "Put 20% down, finance for no more than 4 years, and keep total car costs under 10% of gross income. It's a stricter rule than most dealerships recommend, but it keeps you from being car-poor.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy or lease?",
    a: "Buying builds equity and is cheaper long-term if you keep the car. Leasing gives lower monthly payments and a new car every 2–3 years but you own nothing at the end. If you drive more than 12,000 miles/year or tend to modify your car, buying is usually better.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a car really cost per month?",
    a: "Beyond the loan payment, factor in insurance ($100–200+/month), fuel ($100–300/month), maintenance ($50–100/month), and registration. A $400 loan payment can easily become $750–900 in total monthly car costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What credit score do I need for a good auto loan rate?",
    a: "760+ gets you the best rates (typically 5–7% in 2026). 700–759 is still good. Below 660, you'll likely pay 12–20%+ which significantly increases the total cost of the loan. Improving your credit before buying saves thousands.",
