const FAQS = [
  { q: "What is the average student loan interest rate?", a: "Federal undergraduate loans for 2024–25 are 6.53%. Graduate loans are 8.08%. Private loans vary widely — from 4% to 15%+ depending on your credit score and lender." },
  { q: "How long does it take to pay off student loans?", a: "The standard federal repayment plan is 10 years (120 months). Extended and income-driven plans can stretch to 20–25 years. Paying extra each month significantly shortens the timeline." },
  { q: "Should I pay more than the minimum?", a: "Yes. Even an extra $50–$100/month can save thousands in interest and cut years off your loan. Apply overpayments directly to principal for maximum impact." },
  { q: "Is student loan interest tax deductible?", a: "You can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest per year on your federal taxes if your income is under $85,000 (single) or $170,000 (married filing jointly)." },
  { q: "What's the difference between subsidised and unsubsidised loans?", a: "Subsidised loans don't accrue interest while you're in school. Unsubsidised loans start accruing from the day they're disbursed — meaning you may owe more than you originally borrowed." },
