const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is gross profit margin?",
    a: "Gross profit margin is the percentage of revenue left after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS). A 30% margin means you keep $0.30 of every $1 of revenue after covering direct costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between margin and markup?",
    a: "Margin is profit as a percentage of selling price. Markup is profit as a percentage of cost. A product that costs $70 and sells for $100 has a 30% margin but a 43% markup. They're measuring the same profit from different reference points.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good profit margin?",
    a: "It depends heavily on the industry. Software and SaaS: 60–80%. Retail: 20–50%. Restaurants: 3–9%. Manufacturing: 5–20%. High margins aren't always better — some industries operate profitably on thin margins with high volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between gross and net margin?",
    a: "Gross margin only subtracts COGS from revenue. Net margin subtracts all expenses — COGS, operating costs, taxes, and interest. This calculator computes gross margin. Net margin requires your full income statement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I improve my profit margin?",
    a: "Two levers: increase revenue (raise prices, sell more) or decrease costs (negotiate supplier rates, improve efficiency). Pricing is usually the faster lever — even a 1% price increase has a bigger margin impact than most cost cuts.",

    title: "Pricing is your biggest lever",
    body: "A 1% price increase on $1M revenue is $10,000 in pure profit — no extra cost. A 1% cost reduction on 70% COGS only saves $7,000. Pricing has more leverage than most businesses realise.",
