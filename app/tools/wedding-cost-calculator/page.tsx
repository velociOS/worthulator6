const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does the average wedding cost in the US?",
    a: "The average US wedding costs between $29,000 and $35,000 according to The Knot's annual survey. However, costs vary enormously — a small 30-person wedding can come in under $10,000, while a large celebration of 200+ guests in a major city can exceed $80,000.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the biggest cost at most weddings?",
    a: "Catering is typically the largest line item, often accounting for 30–40% of the total budget. Venue hire is the second biggest cost. Together these two items can easily represent 50–60% of a wedding budget, which is why guest count has such a large impact on total spend.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I budget per guest?",
    a: "A common benchmark is $150–$250 per guest all-in (catering, venue share, favours). Budget weddings can come in at $75–$100/guest with careful planning, while luxury events often exceed $400/guest. Use the calculator to see how your specific choices affect the per-head cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I reduce wedding costs without cutting corners?",
    a: "The highest-impact savings come from reducing guest count (fewer guests = lower catering and venue costs), choosing an off-peak date (Friday evenings or January–March offer venue discounts), limiting the open bar to a reception period only, and sourcing a newer photographer building their portfolio.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I include the honeymoon in my wedding budget?",
    a: "Typically no — the honeymoon is budgeted separately. This calculator covers the ceremony and reception costs only. The average US honeymoon costs $4,500–$7,000 and should be planned as a separate financial goal.",
