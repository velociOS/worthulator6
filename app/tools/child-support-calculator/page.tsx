const FAQS = [
  { q: "How is child support calculated?", a: "Most US states use the Income Shares Model: combine both parents' incomes, determine a basic child support obligation from a guideline table, then split it proportionally. This calculator uses that framework as an estimate." },
  { q: "Does custody affect child support?", a: "Yes. Increased physical custody for the paying parent typically reduces the obligation. Shared parenting at 50/50 can significantly reduce or equalise payments depending on the state." },
  { q: "Is this calculator legally accurate?", a: "No — this is an educational estimate only. Child support amounts vary widely by state, and courts consider many additional factors. Always consult a family law attorney and use your state's official guidelines." },
  { q: "What can child support be used for?", a: "Child support is meant to cover housing, food, clothing, medical care, and education. The paying parent does not get to dictate or audit how the money is spent within those categories." },
  { q: "What happens if I miss a child support payment?", a: "Unpaid child support accumulates as arrears and can result in wage garnishment, license suspension, passport denial, and in extreme cases, criminal charges. Contact the court proactively if you can't pay." },
