          <p className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.28em] text-gray-400">Why we exist</p>
          <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-950">
            The tools existed. They just weren&apos;t useful.
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            <p>
              Money decisions affect everyone — salary negotiations, tax planning, overtime calculations,
              understanding where your money goes. But the tools built to help with these decisions were
              either buried in spreadsheets, locked behind subscriptions, or so technically dense they
              were unusable by anyone who isn&apos;t an accountant.
            </p>
            <p>
              We kept searching for a fast, clean answer to basic questions. How much do I actually
              take home? Is this overtime worth it? What is my hourly rate really worth? Every time,
              the results were either outdated, cluttered with ads, or required creating an account
              just to see a number.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we built Worthulator — a growing set of tools that give you a clear answer in
              seconds. No account. No paywall. No noise.

              Right now, Worthulator is a set of standalone tools. Each one answers a single question.
              That&apos;s intentional — we wanted to get the fundamentals right before connecting the dots.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next phase is to link them. Your take-home pay feeds into your subscription
              affordability. Your overtime earnings connect to your compound interest potential.
              Your hourly rate tells you what your screen time actually costs. We&apos;re building
              toward a platform where each answer leads naturally to the next useful one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not a dashboard. Not a budget app. Just a set of connected tools that help you see
              your finances more clearly — one question at a time.
